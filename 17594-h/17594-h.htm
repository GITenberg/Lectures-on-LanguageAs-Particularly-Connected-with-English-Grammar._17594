<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;The undersigned, in behalf of the Young People's Institute,
hasten to present to you the following <i>Resolutions</i>, together with
their personal thanks, for the Lectures you have delivered before
them, on the Philosophy of Language. The uncommon degree of
interest, pleasure and profit, with which you have been listened to,
is conclusive evidence, that whoever possesses taste and talents to
comprehend and appreciate the philosophy of language, which you
have so successfully cultivated, cannot fail to attain a powerful influence
over the minds of his audience. The Committee respectfully
request you to favor them with a copy of your Lectures for
the Press.</p>

<p class="sign">
Very respectfully,<br />
<span class="sig1">Your most obedient servants,</span><br />
<span class="sig2">C. T. JAMES,</span><br />
<span class="sig2">E. F. MILLER,</span><br />
<span class="sig2">H. L. WEBSTER.</span></p>

<hr class="major" />

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we have been highly entertained and greatly instructed
by the Lectures of our President, on the subject of Language;
that we consider the principles he has advocated, immutably
true, exceedingly important, and capable of an easy adoption in
the study of that important branch of human knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we have long regretted the want of a system to
explain the grammar of our vernacular tongue, on plain, rational,
and consistent principles, in accordance with philosophy and truth,
and in a way to be understood and practised by children and adults.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in our opinion, the manifold attempts which have
been made, though doubtless undertaken with the purest intentions,
to simplify and make easy existing systems, have failed entirely of
their object, and tended only to perplex, rather than enlighten
learners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That in our belief, the publication of these Lectures
would meet the wants of the community, and throw a flood of light
upon this hitherto dark, and intricate, and yet exceedingly interesting
department of a common education, and thus prove of immense
service to the present and future generations.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That Messrs. Charles T. James, Edward F. Miller,
and Henry L. Webster, be a Committee to wait on Rev. William
S. Balch, and request the publication of his very interesting Course
of Lectures before this Institute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. C. T. James, E. F. Miller, and H. L. Webster</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;Your letter, together with the Resolutions accompanying
it, was duly and gratefully received. It gives me no ordinary
degree of pleasure to know that so deep an interest has been,
and still is, felt by the members of our Institute, as well as the public
generally, on this important subject; for it is one which concerns
the happiness and welfare of our whole community; but especially
the rising generation.</p>

<p>The only recommendation of these Lectures is the subject of
which they treat. They were written in the space of a few weeks,
and in the midst of an accumulation of engagements which almost
forbade the attempt. But presuming you will make all due allowances
for whatever errors you may discover in the style of composition,
and regard the <i>matter</i> more than the <i>manner</i>, I consent to
their publication, hoping they will be of some service in the great
cause of human improvement.</p>

<p class="sign">
I am, gentlemen,<br />
<span class="sig1">Very respectfully yours,</span><br />

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>There is no subject so deeply interesting and important to
rational beings as the knowledge of language, or one which
presents a more direct and powerful claim upon all classes
in the community; for there is no other so closely interwoven
with all the affairs of human life, social, moral, political
and religious. It forms a basis on which depends a vast
portion of the happiness of mankind, and deserves the first
attention of every philanthropist.</p>

<p>Great difficulty has been experienced in the common
method of explaining language, and grammar has long been
considered a dry, uninteresting, and tedious study, by nearly
all the teachers and scholars in the land. But it is to be
presumed that the fault in this case, if there is any, is to be
sought for in the manner of teaching, rather than in the
science itself; for it would be unreasonable to suppose that
a subject which occupies the earliest attention of the parent,
which is acquired at great expense of money, time, and
thought, and is employed from the cradle to the grave, in
all our waking hours, can possibly be dull or unimportant,
if rightly explained.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Children have been required to learn verbal forms and
changes, to look at the mere signs of ideas, instead of the
things represented by them. The consequence has been
that the whole subject has become uninteresting to all who
do not possess a retentive verbal memory. The philosophy
of language, the sublime principles on which it depends for
its existence and use, have not been sufficiently regarded to
render it delightful and profitable.</p>

<p>The humble attempt here made is designed to open the
way for an exposition of language on truly philosophical
principles, which, when correctly explained, are abundantly
simple and extensively useful. With what success this point
has been labored the reader will determine.</p>

<p>The author claims not the honor of entire originality.
The principles here advanced have been advocated, believed,
and successfully practised. William S. Cardell, Esq., a
bright star in the firmament of American literature, reduced
these principles to a system, which was taught with triumphant
success by Daniel H. Barnes, formerly of the New-York
High School, one of the most distinguished teachers
who ever officiated in that high and responsible capacity in
our country. Both of these gentlemen, so eminently calculated
to elevate the standard of education, were summoned
from the career of the most active usefulness, from
the scenes they had labored to brighten and beautify by the
aid of their transcendant intellects, to unseen realities in the
world of spirits; where mind communes with mind, and soul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
mingles with soul, disenthraled from error, and embosomed
in the light and love of the Great Parent Intellect.</p>

<p>The author does not pretend to give a system of exposition
in this work suited to the capacities of small children.
It is designed for advanced scholars, and is introductory to
a system of grammar which he has in preparation, which
it is humbly hoped will be of some service in rendering easy
and correct the study of our vernacular language. But
this book, it is thought, may be successfully employed in
the instruction of the higher classes in our schools, and will
be found an efficient aid to teachers in inculcating the sublime
principles of which it treats.</p>

<p>These Lectures, as now presented to the public, it
is believed, will be found to contain some important information
by which all may profit. The reader will bear in
mind that they were written for, and delivered before a popular
audience, and published with very little time for modification.
This will be a sufficient apology for the mistakes
which may occur, and for whatever may have the appearance
of severity, irony, or pleasantry, in the composition.</p>

<p>On the subject of Contractions much more might be said.
But verbal criticisms are rather uninteresting to a common
audience; and hence the consideration of that matter was
made more brief than was at first intended. It will however
be resumed and carried out at length in another work.
The hints given will enable the student to form a tolerable
correct opinion of the use of most of those words and phrases,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
which have long been passed over with little knowledge of
their meaning or importance.</p>

<p>The author is aware that the principles he has advocated
are new and opposed to established systems and the common
method of inculcation. But the difficulties acknowledged
on all hands to exist, is a sufficient justification of this humble
attempt. He will not be condemned for his good intentions.
All he asks is a patient and candid examination,
a frank and honest approval of what is true, and as honest a
rejection of what is false. But he hopes the reader will
avoid a rash and precipitate conclusion, either for or against,
lest he is compelled to do as the author himself once did,
approve what he had previously condemned.</p>

<p>With these remarks he enters the arena, and bares himself
to receive the sentence of the public voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>It is proposed to commence, this evening, a course of
Lectures on the Grammar of the English Language. I am
aware of the difficulties attending this subject, occasioned
not so much by any fault in itself, as by the thousand and
one methods adopted to teach it, the multiplicity of books
pretending to "simplify" it, and the vast contrariety of opinion
entertained by those who profess to be its masters. By
many it has been considered a needless affair, an unnecessary
appendage to a common education; by others, altogether
beyond the reach of common capacities; and by all,
cold, lifeless, and uninteresting, full of doubts and perplexities,
where the wisest have differed, and the firmest often
changed opinions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
All this difficulty originates, I apprehend, in the wrong
view that is taken of the subject. The most beautiful landscape
may appear at great disadvantage, if viewed from an
unfavorable position. I would be slow to believe that the
means on which depends the whole business of the community,
the study of the sciences, all improvement upon the
past, the history of all nations in all ages of the world, social
intercourse, oral or written, and, in a great measure, the
knowledge of God, and the hopes of immortality, can be
either unworthy of study, or, if rightly explained, uninteresting
in the acquisition. In fact, on the principles I am
about to advocate, I have seen the deepest interest manifested,
from the small child to the grey-headed sire, from
the mere novice to the statesman and philosopher, and all
alike seemed to be edified and improved by the attention bestowed
upon the subject.</p>

<p>I confess, however, that with the mention of <i>grammar</i>, an
association of ideas are called up by no means agreeable.
The mind involuntarily reverts to the days of childhood,
when we were compelled, at the risk of our bodily safety,
to commit to memory a set of arbitrary rules, which we
could neither understand nor apply in the correct use of language.
Formerly it was never dreamed that grammar depended
on any higher authority than the books put into our
hands. And learners were not only dissuaded, but strictly
forbidden to go beyond the limits set them in the etymological
and syntactical rules of the authors to whom they
were referred. If a query ever arose in their minds, and
they modestly proposed a plain question as to the <i>why</i> and
<i>wherefore</i> things were thus, instead of giving an answer according
to common sense, in a way to be understood, the
authorities were pondered over, till some rule or remark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
could be found which would apply, and this settled the matter
with "proof as strong as holy writ." In this way an
end may be put to the inquiry; but the thinking mind will
hardly be satisfied with the mere opinion of another, who
has no evidence to afford, save the undisputed dignity of his
station, or the authority of books. This course is easily accounted
for. Rather than expose his own ignorance, the
teacher quotes the printed ignorance of others, thinking, no
doubt, that folly and nonsense will appear better second-handed,
than fresh from his own responsibility. Or else on
the more common score, that "misery loves company."</p>

<p>Teachers have not unfrequently found themselves placed in
an unenviable position by the honest inquiries of some thinking
urchin, who has demanded why "<i>one noun governs</i> another
in the possessive case," as "master's slave;" why
there are more tenses than <i>three</i>; what is meant by a <i>neuter</i>
verb, which "signifies neither action nor passion;" or
an "intransitive verb," which expresses the highest possible
action, but terminates on no object; a cause without an effect;
why <i>that</i> is sometimes a pronoun, sometimes an adjective,
and not unfrequently a conjunction, &amp;c. &amp;c. They
may have succeeded, by dint of official authority, in silencing
such inquiries, but they have failed to give a satisfactory
answer to the questions proposed.</p>

<p>Long received opinions may, in some cases, become law,
pleading no other reason than antiquity. But this is an age
of investigation, which demands the most lucid and unequivocal
proof of the point assumed. The dogmatism of the
schoolmen will no longer satisfy. The dark ages of mental
servility are passing away. The day light of science
has long since dawned upon the world, and the noon day of
truth, reason, and virtue, will ere long be established on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
firm and immutable basis. The human mind, left free to
investigate, will gradually advance onward in the course of
knowledge and goodness marked out by the Creator, till it
attains to that perfection which shall constitute its highest
glory, its truest bliss.</p>

<p>You will perceive, at once, that our inquiries thro out
these lectures will not be bounded by what has been said or
written on the subject. We take a wider range. We adopt
no sentiment because it is ancient or popular. We refer to
no authority but what proves itself to be correct. And we
ask no one to adopt our opinions any farther than they
agree with the fixed laws of nature in the regulation of
matter and thought, and apply in common practice among
men.</p>

<p>Have we not a right to expect, in return, that you will be
equally honest to yourselves and the subject before us? So
far as the errors of existing systems shall be exposed, will
you not reject them, and adopt whatever appears conclusively
true and practically useful? Will you, can you, be
satisfied to adopt for yourselves and teach to others, systems
of grammar, for no other reason than because they
are old, and claim the support of the learned and honorable?</p>

<p>Such a course, generally adopted, would give the ever-lasting
quietus to all improvement. It would be a practical
adoption of the philosophy of the Dutchman, who was content
to carry his grist in one end of the sack and a stone to
balance it in the other, assigning for a reason, that his honored
father had always done so before him. Who would
be content to adopt the astrology of the ancients, in preferance
to astronomy as now taught, because the latter is more
modern? Who would spend three years in transcribing a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
copy of the Bible, when a better could be obtained for one
dollar, because manuscripts were thus procured in former
times? What lady would prefer to take her cards, wheel,
and loom, and spend a month or two in manufacturing for
herself a dress, when a better could be earned in half the
time, merely because her respected grandmother did so before
her? Who would go back a thousand years to find a
model for society, rejecting all improvements in the arts
and sciences, because they are innovations, encroachments
upon the opinions and practices of learned and honorable
men?</p>

<p>I can not believe there is a person in this respected audience
whose mind is in such voluntary slavery as to induce
the adoption of such a course. I see before me minds which
sparkle in every look, and thoughts which are ever active,
to acquire what is true, and adopt what is useful. And I
flatter myself that the time spent in the investigation of the
science of language will not be unpleasant or unprofitable.</p>

<p>I feel the greater confidence from the consideration that
your minds are yet untrammeled; not but what many,
probably most of you, have already studied the popular systems
of grammar, and understood them; if such a thing is
possible; but because you have shown a disposition to learn,
by becoming members of this Institute, the object of which
is the improvement of its members.</p>

<p>Let us therefore make an humble attempt, with all due
candor and discretion, to enter upon the inquiry before us
with an unflinching determination to push our investigations
beyond all reasonable doubt, and never rest satisfied till we
have conquered all conquerable obstacles, and come into
the possession of the light and liberty of truth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The attempt here made will not be considered unimportant,
by those who have known the difficulties attending the
study of language. If any course can be marked out to
shorten the time tediously spent in the acquisition of what is
rarely attained&mdash;a thoro knowledge of language&mdash;a great
benefit will result to the community; children will save
months and years to engage in other useful attainments,
and the high aspirations of the mind for truth and knowledge
will not be curbed in its first efforts to improve by a
set of technical and arbitrary rules. They will acquire a
habit of thinking, of deep reflection; and never adopt, for
fact, what appears unreasonable or inconsistent, merely because
great or good men have said it is so. They will feel
an independence of their own, and adopt a course of investigation
which cannot fail of the most important consequences.
It is not the saving of time, however, for
which we propose a change in the system of teaching language.
In this respect, it is the study of one's life. New
facts are constantly developing themselves, new combinations
of ideas and words are discovered, and new beauties
presented at every advancing step. It is to acquire a knowledge
of correct principles, to induce a habit of correct
thinking, a freedom of investigation, and at that age when the
character and language of life are forming. It is, in short,
to exhibit before you truth of the greatest practical importance,
not only to you, but to generations yet unborn, in the
most essential affairs of human life, that I have broached
the hated subject of grammar, and undertaken to reflect
light upon this hitherto dark and disagreeable subject.</p>

<p>With a brief sketch of the outlines of language, as based
on the fixed laws of nature, and the agreement of those
who employ it, I shall conclude the present lecture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
We shall consider all language as governed by the invariable
laws of nature, and as depending on the conventional
regulations of men.</p>

<p>Words are the signs of ideas. Ideas are the impressions
of things. Hence, in all our attempts to investigate the important
principles of language, we shall employ the sign as
the means of coming at the thing signified.</p>

<p>Language has usually been considered under four divisions,
viz.: Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.</p>

<p>Orthography is <i>right spelling</i>; the combination of certain
letters into words in such a manner as to agree with the
spoken words used to denote an idea. We shall not labor
this point, altho we conceive a great improvement might be
effected in this department of learning. My only wish is to
select from all the forms of spelling, the most simple and
consistent. Constant changes are taking place in the method
of making words, and we would not refuse to cast in our
mite to make the standard more correct and easy. We
would prune off by degrees all unnecessary appendages, as
unsounded or italic letters, and write out words so as to be
capable of a distinct pronunciation. But this change must
be <i>gradually</i> effected. From the spelling adopted two centuries
ago, a wonderful improvement has taken place.
And we have not yet gone beyond the possibility of improvement.
Let us not be too sensitive on this point, nor
too tenacious of old forms. Most of our dictionaries differ
in many respects in regard to the true system of orthography,
and our true course is to adopt every improvement
which is offered. Thro out this work we shall spell some
words different from what is customary, but intend not,
thereby, to incur the ignominy of bad spellers. Let small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
improvements be adopted, and our language may soon be
redeemed from the difficulties which have perplexed beginners
in their first attempts to convey ideas by written
words.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In that department of language denominated Etymology,
we shall contend that all words are reducible to two general
classes, nouns and verbs; or, <i>things</i> and <i>actions</i>. We
shall, however, admit of subdivisions, and treat of pronouns,
adjectives, and contractions. We shall contend for only
two cases of nouns, one kind of pronouns, one kind of verbs,
that all are active; three modes, and as many tenses; that
articles, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections,
have no distinctive character, no existence, in fact, to
warrant a "local habitation or a name."</p>

<p>In the composition of sentences, a few general rules of
Syntax may be given; but the principal object to be obtained,
is the possession of correct ideas derived from a
knowledge of things, and the most approved words to express
them; the combination of words in a sentence will
readily enough follow.</p>

<p>Prosody relates to the quantity of syllables, rules of accent
and pronunciation, and the arrangement of syllables
and words so as to produce harmony. It applies specially
to versification. As our object is not to make poets, who,
it is said, "are born, and not made," but to teach the true
principles of language, we shall give no attention to this finishing
stroke of composition.</p>

<p>In our next we shall lay before you the principles upon
which all language depends, and the process by which its
use is to be acquired.</p>

<h3>FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LANGUAGE.</h3>

<div class="summary"><p>General principles of Language. &mdash; Business of Grammar. &mdash; Children
are Philosophers. &mdash; Things, ideas, and words. &mdash; Actions. &mdash; Qualities
of things. &mdash; Words without ideas. &mdash; Grammatical terms inappropriate. &mdash; Principles
of Language permanent. &mdash; Errors in mental

of qualities. &mdash; An example. &mdash; New ideas. &mdash; Unknown words. &mdash; Signs
without things signified. &mdash; Fixed laws regulate matter and
mind.</p></div>


<p>All language depends on two general principles.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The fixed and unvarying laws of nature which
regulate matter and mind.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The agreement of those who use it.</p>

<p>In accordance with these principles all language must be
explained. It is not only needless but impossible for us to
deviate from them. They remain the same in all ages and
in all countries. It should be the object of the grammarian,
and of all who employ language in the expression of
ideas, to become intimately acquainted with their use.</p>

<p>It is the business of grammar to explain, not only verbal
language, but also the sublime principles upon which all
written or spoken language depends. It forms an important
part of physical and mental science, which, correctly explained,
is abundantly simple and extensively useful in its
application to the affairs of human life and the promotion of
human enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
It will not be contended that we are assuming a position
beyond the capacities of learners, that the course here adopted
is too philosophic. Such is not the fact. Children are philosophers
by nature. All their ideas are derived from things
as presented to their observations. No mother learns
her child to lisp the name of a thing which has no being,
but she chooses objects with which it is most familiar,
and which are most constantly before it; such as father,
mother, brother, sister.</p>

<p>She constantly points to the object named, that a distinct
impression may be made upon its mind, and the thing
signified, the idea of the thing, and the name which represents
it, are all inseparably associated together. If the father
is absent, the child may <i>think</i> of him from the idea or impression
which his person and affection has produced in the
mind. If the mother pronounces his <i>name</i> with which it has
become familiar, the child will start, look about for the object,
or thing signified by the <i>name</i>, father, and not being
able to discover him, will settle down contented with the
<i>idea</i> of him deeply impressed on the mind, and as distinctly
understood as if the father was present in person. So with
every thing else.</p>

<p>Again, after the child has become familiar with the name
of the being called father; the name, idea and object itself
being intimately associated the mother will next begin to
teach it another lesson; following most undeviatingly the
course which nature and true philosophy mark out. The
father comes and goes, is present or absent. She says on
his return, father <i>come</i>, and the little one looks round to see
the thing signified by the word father, the idea of which is
distinctly impressed on the mind, and which it now sees present
before it. But this loved object has not always been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
here. It had looked round and called for the father. But
the mother had told it <i>he was gone</i>. Father gone, father
come, is her language, and here the child begins to learn
ideas of actions. Of this it had, at first, no notion whatever,
and never thought of the father except when his person
was present before it, for no impressions had been distinctly
made upon the mind which could be called up by a sound
of which it could have no conceptions whatever. Now
that it has advanced so far, the idea of the father is retained,
even tho he is himself absent, and the child begins to associate
the notion of coming and going with his presence or absence.
Following out this course the mind becomes acquainted
with things and actions, or the changes which
things undergo.</p>

<p>Next, the mother begins to learn her offspring the distinction
and qualities of things. When the little sister
comes to it in innocent playfulness the mother says, "<i>good</i>
sister," and with the descriptive word <i>good</i> it soon begins to
associate the quality expressed by the affectionate regard,
of its sister. But when that sister strikes the child, or pesters
it in any way, the mother says "<i>naughty</i> sister," "bad
sister." It soon comprehends the descriptive words, <i>good</i>
and <i>bad</i>, and along with them carries the association of ideas
which such conduct produces. In the same way it learns
to distinguish the difference between <i>great</i> and <i>small</i>, <i>cold</i>
and <i>hot</i>, hard and soft.</p>

<p>In this manner the child becomes acquainted with the
use of language. It first becomes acquainted with things,
the idea of which is left upon the mind, or, more properly,
the <i>impression of which</i>, left on the mind, <i>constitutes the
idea</i>; and a vocabulary of words are learned, which represent
these ideas, from which it may select those best
calcu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>lated
to express its meaning whenever a conversation is
had with another.</p>

<p>You will readily perceive the correctness of our first
proposition, that all language depends on the fixed and unerring
laws of nature. Things exist. A knowledge of
them produces ideas in the mind, and sounds or signs are
adopted as vehicles to convey these ideas from one to
another.</p>

<p>It would be absurd and ridiculous to suppose that any
person, however great, or learned, or wise, could employ
language correctly without a knowledge of the things expressed
by that language. No matter how chaste his words,
how lofty his phrases, how sweet the intonations, or mellow
the accents. It would avail him nothing if <i>ideas</i> were not
represented thereby. It would all be an unknown tongue
to the hearer or reader. It would not be like the loud
rolling thunder, for that tells the wondrous power of God.
It would not be like the soft zephyrs of evening, the radiance
of the sun, the twinkling of the stars; for they speak
the intelligible language of sublimity itself, and tell of the
kindness and protection of our Father who is in heaven.
It would not be like the sweet notes of the choral songsters
of the grove, for they warble hymns of gratitude to God;
not like the boding of the distant owl, for that tells the profound
solemnity of night; not like the hungry lion roaring
for his prey, for that tells of death and plunder; not like
the distant notes of the clarion, for that tells of blood and
carnage, of tears and anguish, of widowhood and orphanage.
It can be compared to nothing but a Babel of confusion
in which their own folly is worse confounded. And
yet, I am sorry to say it, the languages of all ages and nations
have been too frequently perverted, and compiled into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a heterogeneous mass of abstruse, metaphysical volumes,
whose only recommendation is the elegant bindings in which
they are enclosed.</p>

<p>And grammars themselves, whose pretended object is to
teach the rules of speaking and writing correctly, form but
a miserable exception to this sweeping remark. I defy any
grammarian, author, or teacher of the numberless systems,
which come, like the frogs of Egypt, all of one genus, to
cover the land, to give a reasonable explanation of even the
terms they employ to define their meaning, if indeed, meaning
they have. What is meant by an "<i>in</i>-definite article,"
a <i>dis</i>-junctive <i>con</i>-junction, an <i>ad</i>-verb which qualifies an
<i>adjective</i>, and "sometimes another <i>ad</i>-verb?" Such "parts of
speech" have no existence in fact, and their adoption in rules
of grammar, have been found exceedingly mischievous and
perplexing. "Adverbs and conjunctions," and "<i>adverbial</i>
phrases," and "conjunctive expressions," may serve as common
sewers for a large and most useful class of words,
which the teachers of grammar and lexicographers have
been unable to explain; but learners will gain little information
by being told that such is an <i>adverbial phrase</i>, and
such, a <i>conjunctive expression</i>. This is an easy method, I
confess, a sort of wholesale traffic, in parsing (<i>passing</i>) language,
and may serve to cloak the ignorance of the teachers
and makers of grammars. But it will reflect little light
on the principles of language, or prove very efficient helps
to "speak or write with propriety." Those who <i>think</i>, will
demand the <i>meaning</i> of these words, and the reason of their
use. When that is ascertained, little difficulty will be found
in giving them a place in the company of respectable words.
But I am digressing. More shall be said upon this point in
a future lecture, and in its proper place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
I was endeavoring to establish the position that all language
depends upon permanent principles; that words are
the signs of ideas, and ideas are the impressions of things
communicated to the mind thro the medium of some one of
the five senses. I think I have succeeded so far as simple
material things are concerned, to the satisfaction of all who
have heard me. It may, perhaps, be more difficult for me
to explain the words employed to express complex ideas,
and things of immateriality, such as mind, and its attributes.
But the rules previously adopted will, I apprehend, apply
with equal ease and correctness in this case; and we shall
have cause to admire the simple yet sublime foundation upon
which the whole superstructure of language is based.</p>

<p>In pursuing this investigation I shall endeavor to avoid
all abstruse and metaphysical reasoning, present no wild
conjectures, or vain hypotheses; but confine myself to plain,
common place matter of fact. We have reason to rejoice
that a wonderful improvement in the science and cultivation
of the mind has taken place in these last days; that we are
no longer puzzled with the strange phantoms, the wild speculations
which occupied the giant minds of a Descartes, a
Malebranch, a Locke, a Reid, a Stewart, and hosts of others,
whose shining talents would have qualified them for the
brightest ornaments of literature, real benefactors of mankind,
had not their education lead them into dark and metaphysical
reasonings, a continued tissue of the wildest vagaries,
in which they became entangled, till, at length, they
were entirely lost in the labyrinth of their own conjectures.</p>

<p>The occasion of all their difficulty originated in an attempt
to investigate the faculties of the mind without any means
of getting at it. They did not content themselves with an
adoption of the principles which lay at the foundation of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
true philosophy, viz., that the facts to be accounted for, <i>do
exist</i>; that truth is eternal, and we are to become acquainted
with it by the means employed for its development. They
quitted the world of materiality they inhabited, refused to
examine the development of mind as the effect of an existing
cause; and at one bold push, entered the world of
thought, and made the unhallowed attempt to reason, a priori,
concerning things which can only be known by their
manifestations. But they soon found themselves in a strange
land, confused with sights and sounds unknown, in the <i>explanation</i>
of which they, of course, choose terms as unintelligible
to their readers, as the <i>ideal realities</i> were to them.
This course, adopted by Aristotle, has been too closely followed
by those who have come after
him.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
But a new era
has dawned upon the philosophy of the mind, and a corresponding
change in the method of inculcating the principles
of language must
follow.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In all our investigations we must take things as we find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
them, and account for them as far as we can. It would be a
thankless task to attempt a change of principles in any thing.
That would be an encroachment of the Creator's rights. It
belongs to mortals to use the things they have as not abusing
them; and to Deity to regulate the laws by which those
things are governed. And that man is the wisest, the truest
philosopher, and brightest Christian, who acquaints himself
with those laws as they do exist in the regulation of matter
and mind, in the promotion of physical and moral enjoyment,
and endeavors to conform to them in all his thoughts
and actions.</p>

<p>From this apparent digression you will at once discover
our object. We must not endeavor to change the principles
of language, but to understand and explain them; to
ascertain, as far as possible, the actions of the mind in obtaining
ideas, and the use of language in expressing them.
We may not be able to make our sentiments understood;
but if they are not, the fault will originate in no obscurity
in the facts themselves, but in our inability either to understand
them or the words employed in their expression. Having
been in the habit of using words with either no meaning
or a wrong one, it may be difficult to comprehend the
subject of which they treat. A man may have a quantity
of sulphur, charcoal, and nitre, but it is not until he learns
their properties and combinations that he can make gunpowder.
Let us then adopt a careful and independent course
of reasoning, resolved to meddle with nothing we do not understand,
and to use no words until we know their meaning.</p>

<p>A complex idea is a combination of several simple ones,
as a tree is made up of roots, a trunk, branches, twigs, and
leaves. And these again may be divided into the wood,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the bark, the sap, &amp;c. Or we may employ the botanical
terms, and enumerate its external and internal parts and
qualities; the whole anatomy and physiology, as well as
variety and history of trees of that species, and show its
characteristic distinctions; for the mind receives a different
impression on looking at a maple, a birch, a poplar, a tamarisk,
a sycamore, or hemlock. In this way complex ideas
are formed, distinct in their parts, but blended in a common
whole; and, in conformity with the law regulating language,
words, sounds or signs, are employed to express the complex
whole, or each distinctive part. The same may be
said of all things of like character. But this idea I will
illustrate more at large before the close of this lecture.</p>

<p>First impressions are produced by a view of material
things, as we have already seen; and the notion of action
is obtained from a knowledge of the changes these things
undergo. The idea of quality and definition is produced by
contrast and comparison. Children soon learn the difference
between a sweet apple and a sour one, a white rose
and a red one, a hard seat and a soft one, harmonious sounds
and those that are discordant, a pleasant smell and one
that is disagreeable. As the mind advances, the application
is varied, and they speak of a sweet rose, changing
from <i>taste</i> and <i>sight</i> to smell, of a sweet song, of a hard apple,
&amp;c. According to the qualities thus learned, you may
talk to them intelligibly of the <i>sweetness</i> of an apple, the
<i>color</i> of a rose, the <i>hardness</i> of iron, the <i>harmony</i> of sounds,
the <i>smell</i> or scent of things which possess that quality. As
these agree or disagree with their comfort, they will call
them <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>, and speak of the qualities of goodness and
badness, as if possessed by the thing itself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
In this apparently indiscriminate use of words, the ideas
remain distinct; and each sign or object calls them up separately
and associates them together, till, at length, in the
single object is associated all the ideas entertained of its size,
qualities, relations, and affinities.</p>

<p>In this manner, after long, persevering toil, principles of
thought are fixed, and a foundation laid for the whole course
of future thinking and speaking. The ideas become less
simple and distinct. Just as fast as the mind advances in the
knowledge of things, language keeps pace with the ideas,
and even goes beyond them, so that in process of time
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'as ingle'">a single</ins>
term will not
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unfrequenly'">unfrequently</ins>
represent a complexity of
ideas, one of which will signify a whole combination of
things.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are many instances where the
single declaration of a fact may convey to the untutored
mind, a single thought or nearly so, when the better cultivated
will take into the account the whole process by
which it is effected. To illustrate: <i>a man killed a deer</i>.
Here the boy would see and imagine more than he is yet
fully able to comprehend. He will see the obvious fact that
the man levels his musket, the gun goes off with a loud report,
and the deer falls and dies. How this is all produced
he does not understand, but knowing the fact he asserts the
single truth&mdash;the man killed the deer. As the child advances,
he will learn that the sentence conveys to the mind more
than he at first perceived. He now understands how it was
accomplished. The man had a gun. Then he must go
back to the gunsmith and see how it was made, thence back
to the iron taken from its bed, and wrought into bars; all
the processes by which it is brought into the shape of a gun,
the tools and machinery employed; the wood for the stock,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
its quality and production; the size, form and color of the
lock, the principle upon which it moves; the flint, the effect
produced by a collision with the steel, or a percussion cap,
and its composition; till he finds a single gun in the hands of
a man. The man is present with this gun. The motives
which brought him here; the movements of his limbs, regulated
by the determinations of the mind, and a thousand
other such thoughts, might be taken into the account. Then
the deer, his size, form, color, manner of living, next may
claim a passing thought. But I need not enlarge. Here
they both stand. The man has just seen the deer. As
quick as thought his eye passes over the ground, sees the
prey is within proper distance, takes aim, pulls the trigger,
that loosens a spring, which forces the flint against the steel;
this produces a spark, which ignites the charcoal, and the
sulphur and nitre combined, explode and force the wad,
which forces the ball from the gun, and is borne thro the
air till it reaches the deer, enters his body by displacing the
skin and flesh, deranges the animal functions, and death ensues.
The whole and much more is expressed in the single
phrase, "a man killed a deer."</p>

<p>It would be needless for me to stop here, and examine all
the operations of the mind in coming at this state of knowledge.
That is not the object of the present work. Such
a duty belongs to another treatise, which may some day be
undertaken, on logic and the science of the mind. The hint
here given will enable you to perceive how the mind expands,
and how language keeps pace with every advancing
step, and, also, how combinations are made from simple
things, as a house is made of timber, boards, shingles, nails,
and paints; or of bricks, stone, and mortar; as the case
may be, and when completed, a single term may express
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the idea, and you speak of a wood, or a brick house. Following
this suggestion, by tracing the operations of the
mind in the young child, or your own, very minutely, in the
acquisition of any knowledge before wholly unknown to you,
as a new language, or a new science; botany, mineralogy,
chemistry, or phrenology; you will readily discover how
the mind receives new impressions of things, and a new vocabulary
is adopted to express the ideas formed of plants,
minerals, chemical properties, and the development of the
capacities of the mind as depending on material organs;
how these things are changed and combined; and how their
existence and qualities, changes and combinations, are expressed
by words, to be retained, or conveyed to other minds.</p>

<p>But suppose you talk to a person wholly unacquainted
with these things, will he understand you? Talk to him of
stamens, pistils, calyxes; of monandria, diandria, triandria;
of gypsum, talc, calcareous spar, quartz, topaz, mica, garnet,
pyrites, hornblende, augite, actynolite; of hexahedral,
prismatic, rhomboidal, dodecahedral; of acids and alkalies;
of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon; of the configuration
of the brain, and its relative powers; do all this, and
what will he know of your meaning? So of all science.
Words are to be understood from the things they are employed
to represent. You may as well talk to a man in
the hebrew, chinese, or choctaw languages, as in our own,
if he does not know what is signified by the words selected
as the medium of thought.</p>

<p>Your language may be most pure, perfect, full of meaning,
but you cannot make yourself understood till your
hearers can look thro your signs to the things signified.
You may as well present before them a picture of <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>The great fault in the popular system of education is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
easily accounted for, particularly in reference to language.
Children are taught to study signs without looking at the
thing signified. In this way they are mere copyists, and
the mind can never expand so as to make them independent,
original thinkers. In fact, they can, in this way, never
learn to reason well or employ language correctly; no
more than a painter can be successful in his art, by merely
looking at the pictures of others without having ever seen
the originals. A good artist is a close observer of nature.
So children should be left free to examine and reflect, and
the signs will then serve their proper use&mdash;the means of
acquiring the knowledge of things. In vain you may give
a scholar a knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, or Latin,
learn him to translate with rapidity or speak our own language
fluently. If he has not thereby learned the knowledge
of things signified by such language, he is, in principle, advanced
no farther than the parrot which says "pretty
poll, pretty poll."</p>

<p>I am happy, however, in the consideration that a valuable
change is taking place in this respect. Geography is
no longer taught on the old systems, but maps are given
to represent more vividly land and water, rivers, islands,
and mountains. The study of arithmetic, chemistry, and
nearly all the sciences have been materially improved within
a few years. Grammar alone remains in quiet possession
of its unquestioned authority. Its nine "parts of
speech," its three genders, its three cases, its half dozen
kinds of pronouns, and as many moods and tenses, have
rarely been disquieted. A host of book makers have fondled
around them, but few have dared molest them, finding
them so snugly ensconced under the sanctity of age, and
the venerated opinions of learned and good men. Of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
numberless attempts to simplify grammar, what has been
the success? Wherein do modern "simplifiers" differ from
Murray? and he was only a <i>compiler</i>! They have all
discovered his errors. But who has corrected them? They
have all deviated somewhat from his manner. But what
is that but saying, that with all his grammatical knowledge,
he could not explain his own meaning?</p>

<p>All the trouble originates in this; the rules of grammar
have not been sought for where they are only to be found,
in the laws that govern matter and thought. Arbitrary rules
have been adopted which will never apply in practice, except
in special cases, and the attempt to bind language down
to them is as absurd as to undertake to chain thought, or
stop the waters of Niagara with a straw. Language will
go on, and keep pace with the mind, and grammar should
explain it so as to be correctly understood.</p>

<p>I wish you to keep these principles distinctly in view all
thro my remarks, that you may challenge every position I
assume till proved to be correct&mdash;till you distinctly understand
it and definite impressions are made upon your minds.
In this way you will discover a beauty and perfection in
language before unknown; its rules will be found few and
simple, holding with most unyielding tenacity to the sublime
principles upon which they depend; and you will have reason
to admire the works and adore the character of the
great Parent Intellect, whose presence and protection pervade
all his works and regulate the laws of matter and
mind. You will feel yourselves involuntarily filled with
sentiments of gratitude for the gift of mind, its affections,
powers, and means of operation and communication, and
resolved more than ever to employ these faculties in human
improvement and the advancement of general happiness.</p>

<h3>WRITTEN AND SPOKEN LANGUAGE.</h3>

<div class="summary"><p>Principles never alter. &mdash;
They should be known. &mdash; Grammar a most
important branch of science. &mdash; Spoken and written Language. &mdash; Idea
of a thing. &mdash; How expressed. &mdash; An example. &mdash; Picture writing. &mdash; An
anecdote. &mdash; Ideas expressed by actions. &mdash; Principles of
spoken and written Language. &mdash; Apply universally. &mdash; Two examples. &mdash; English
language. &mdash; Foreign words. &mdash; Words in science. &mdash; New
words. &mdash; How formed.</p></div>


<p>We now come to take a nearer view of language as generally
understood by grammar. But we shall have no occasion
to depart from the principles already advanced, for
there is existing in practice nothing which may not be accounted
for in theory; as there can be no effect without an
efficient cause to produce it.</p>

<p>We may, however, long remain ignorant of the true explanation
of the principles involved; but the fault is ours,
and not in the things themselves. The earth moved with
as much grandeur and precision around its axis and in its
orbit before the days of Gallileo Gallilei, when philosophers
believed it flat and stationary, as it has done since. So the
great principles on which depends the existence and use of
all language are permanent, and may be correctly employed
by those who have never examined them; but this does not
prove that to be ignorant is better than to be wise. We
may have taken food all our days without knowing much
of the process by which it is converted into nourishment and
incorporated into our bodies, without ever having heard of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
delutition chymification, chylification, or even digestion, as
a whole; but this is far from convincing me that the knowledge
of these things is unimportant, or that ignorance of them
is not the cause of much disease and suffering among mankind.
And it is, or should be, the business of the physiologist
to explain these things, and show the great practical
benefit resulting from a general knowledge of them. So
the grammarian should act as a sort of physiologist of language.
He should analyze all its parts and show how it
is framed together to constitute a perfect whole.</p>

<p>Instead of exacting of you a blind submission to a set of
technical expressions, and arbitrary rules, I most urgently
exhort you to continue, with unremitting assiduity, your inquiries
into the reason and propriety of the positions which
may be taken. It is the business of philosophy, not to
meddle with things to direct how they should be, but to account
for them and their properties and relations as they
are. So it is the business of grammar to explain language
as it exists in use, and exhibit the reason why it is used
thus, and what principles must be observed to employ it
correctly in speaking and writing. This method is adopted
to carry out the principles already established, and show
their adaptation to the wants of the community, and how
they may be correctly and successfully employed. Grammar
considered in this light forms a department in the science
of the mind by no means unimportant. And it can not
fail to be deeply interesting to all who would employ it in
the business, social, literary, moral, or religious concerns of
life. Those who have thoughts to communicate, or desire
an acquaintance with the minds of others, can not be indifferent
to the means on which such intercourse depends. I
am convinced, therefore, that you will give me your most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
profound attention as I pursue the subject of the present
lecture somewhat in detail. And I hope you will not consider
me tedious or unnecessarily prolix in my remarks.</p>

<p>I will not be particular in my remarks upon the changes
of spoken and written language, altho that topic of itself, in
the different sounds and signs employed in different ages
and by different nations to express the same idea, would
form a most interesting theme for several lectures. But
that work must be reserved for a future occasion. You
are all acquainted with the signs, written and spoken, which
are employed in our language as vehicles (some of them
like omnibusses) of thought to carry ideas from one mind
to another. Some of you doubtless are acquainted with the
application of this fact in other languages. In other words,
you know how to sound the name of a thing, how to describe
its properties as far as you understand them, and its
attitudes or changes. This you can do by vocal sounds, or
written, or printed signs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you can receive a similar impression
by hearing the description of another, or by seeing it written
or printed. But here you will bear in mind the fact
that the word, spoken or written, is but the sign of the idea
derived from the thing signified. For example: Here is
an apple. I do not now speak of its composition, the skin,
the pulp, &amp;c.; nor of its qualities, whether sour, or sweet,
or bitter, good or bad, great or small, long or short, round
or flat, red, or white, or yellow. I speak of a single thing&mdash;an
apple. Here it is, present before you. Look at it.
It is now removed. You do not see it. Your minds are
occupied with something else, in looking at that organ, or this
representation of Solomon's temple, or, perhaps, lingering
in melancholy review of your old systems of grammar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
thro which you plodded at a tedious rate, goaded on by the
stimulus of the ferule, or the fear of being called ignorant.
From that unhappy reverie I recal your minds, by saying
<i>apple</i>. An apple? where? There is none in sight. No;
but you have distinct recollections of a single object I just
now held before you. You see it, mentally, and were you
painters you might paint its likeness. What has brought
this object so vividly before you? The single sound <i>apple</i>.
This sound has called up the idea produced in your mind
on looking at this object which I now again present before
you. Here is the thing represented&mdash;the apple. Again I
lay it aside, and commence a conversation with you on the
varieties of apples, the form, color, flavor, manner of production,
their difference from other fruit, where found, when,
and by whom. Here! look again. What do you see?
A-P-P-L-E&mdash;<i>Apple</i>. What is that? The representation
of the idea produced in the mind by a certain object you
saw a little while ago. Here then you have the spoken
and written signs of this single object I now again present
to your vision. This idea may also be called up by the
sense of feeling, smelling, or tasting, under certain restrictions.
Here you would be no more liable to be mistaken
than by seeing. We can indeed imagine things which would
feel, and smell, and taste, and look some like an apple, but
it falls to the lot of more abstruse reasoners to make their
suppositions, and then account for them&mdash;to imagine things,
and then treat of them as realities. We are content with
the knowledge of things as they do exist, and think there is
little danger of mistaking a potato for an apple, or a squash
for a pear. Tho in the dark we may lay hold of the
Frenchman's <i>pomme de terre</i>&mdash;apple of the earth, the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bite will satisfy us of our mistake if we are not too metaphysical.</p>

<p>The same idea may be called up in your minds by a picture
of the apple presented to your sight. On this ground
the picture writing of the ancients may be accounted for;
and after that, the hieroglyphics of Egypt and other countries,
which was but a step from picture writing towards the
use of the alphabet. But these signs or vehicles for the
conveyance or transmission of their thoughts, compared
with the present perfect state of language, were as aukward
and uncomly as the carriages employed for the conveyance
of their bodies were compared with those now in use.
They were like ox carts drawn by mules, compared with
the most splendid barouches drawn by elegant dapple-greys.</p>

<p>A similar mode would be adopted now by those unacquainted
with alphabetical writing. It was so with the
merchant who could not write. He sold his neighbor a
grindstone, on trust. Lest he should forget it&mdash;lest the <i>idea</i>
of it should be obliterated from the mind&mdash;he, in the absence
of his clerk, took his book and a pen and drew out a <i>round
picture</i> to represent it. Some months after, he dunned his
neighbor for his pay for a cheese. "I have bought no
cheese of you," was the reply. Yes, you have, for I have
it charged. "You must be mistaken, for I never bought a
cheese. We always make our own." How then should
I have one charged to you? "I cannot tell. I have never
had any thing here on credit except a grindstone." Ah!
that's it, that's it, only I forgot to make a hole through
it!"</p>

<p>Ideas may also be exchanged by actions. This is the
first and strongest language of nature. It may be employed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
when words have failed, in the most effectual manner.
The angry man, choked with rage, unable to speak, tells
the violent passions, burning in his bosom, in a language
which can not be mistaken. The actions of a friend are a
surer test of friendship than all the honied words he may
utter. Actions speak louder than words. The first impressions
of maternal affection are produced in the infant
mind by the soothing attentions of the mother. In the same
way we may understand the language of the deaf and dumb.
Certain motions express certain ideas. These being duly
arranged and conformed to our alphabetic signs, and well
understood, the pupil may become acquainted with book
knowledge as well as we. They go by sight and not by
sound. A different method is adopted with the blind. Letters
with them are so arranged that they can <i>feel</i> them.
The signs thus felt correspond with the sounds they hear.
Here they must stop. They cannot see to describe. Those
who are so unfortunate as to be blind and deaf, can have
but a faint knowledge of language, or the ideas of others.</p>

<p>On similar principles we may explain the pantomime
plays sometimes performed, where the most entertaining
scenes of love and murder are represented, but not a word
spoken.</p>

<p>Three things are always to be born in mind in the use
and study of all language: 1st, the thing signified; 2d, the
idea of the thing; and 3d, the word or sign chosen to represent
it.</p>

<p><i>Things</i> exist.</p>

<p>Thinking beings conceive <i>ideas of things</i>.</p>

<p>Those who employ language adopt <i>sounds or signs to
convey those ideas</i> to others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
On these obvious principles rest the whole superstructure
of all language, spoken or written. Objects are presented
to the mind, impressions are there made, which, retained,
constitute the idea, and, by agreement, certain words are
employed as the future signs or representations of those
ideas. If we saw an object in early life and knew its <i>name</i>,
the mention of that name will recal afresh the idea which
had long lain dormant in the memory, (if I may so speak,)
and we can converse about it as correctly as when we first
saw it.</p>

<p>These principles, I have said, hold good in all languages.
Proof of this may not improperly be offered here, provided
it be not too prolix. I will endeavor to be brief.</p>

<p>In an open area of sufficient dimensions is congregated
a delegation from every language under heaven. All are
so arranged as to face a common center. A white horse
is led into that spot and all look at the living animal
which stands before them. The same impression must be
made on all minds so far as a single animal is concerned.
But as the whole is made up of parts, so their minds will
soon diverge from a single idea, and one will think of his
size, compared with other horses; another of his form; another
of his color. Some will think of his noble appearance,
others of his ability to travel, or (in jockey phrase) his
<i>speed</i>. The farrier will look for his blemishes, to see if he
is <i>sound</i>, and the jockey at his teeth, to <i>guess</i> at his <i>age</i>.
The anatomist will, in thought, dissect him into parts and
see every bone, sinew, cartilage, blood vessel, his stomach,
lungs, liver, heart, entrails; every part will be laid open;
and while the thoughtless urchin sees a single object&mdash;a
white horse&mdash;others will, at a single glance, read volumes of
instruction. Oh! the importance of knowledge! how little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is it regarded! What funds of instruction might be gathered
from the lessons every where presented to the mind!</p>

<p>One impression would be made on all minds in reference
to the single tangible object before them; no matter how
learned or ignorant. There stands an animal obvious to
all. Let him be removed out of sight, and a very exact
picture of him suspended in his place. All again agree.
Here then is the proof of our first general principle, viz. all
language depends on the fixed and unvarying laws of nature.</p>

<p>Let the picture be removed and a man step forth and
pronounce the word, <i>ippos</i>. The Greek starts up and says,
"Yes, it is so." The rest do not comprehend him. He then
writes out distinctly, &#921;&#928;&#928;&#927;&#931;. They are in the dark
as to the meaning. They know not whether a horse, a
man, or a goose is named. All the Greeks, however, understand
the meaning the same as when the horse or picture
was before them, for they had <i>agreed</i> that <i>ippos</i> should
represent the <i>idea</i> of that animal.</p>

<p>Forth steps another, and pronounces the word <i>cheval</i>.
Every Frenchman is aroused: Oui, monsieur? Yes, sir.
Comprenez vous? Do you understand? he says to the rest.
But they are dumb. He then writes C-H-E-V-A-L.
All are as ignorant as before, save the Frenchmen who had
agreed that <i>cheval</i> should be the name for horse.</p>

<p>Next go yourself, thinking all will understand you, and
say, <i>horse</i>; but, lo! none unacquainted with your language
are the wiser for the sound you utter, or the sign you suspended
before them; save, perhaps, a little old Saxon, who,
at first looks deceived by the similarity of sound, but, seeing
the sign, is as demure as ever, for he omits the <i>e</i>, and pronounces
it shorter than we do, more like a yorkshire man.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
But why are you not understood? Because others have
not entered into an <i>agreement</i> with you that <i>h-o-r-s-e</i>, spoken
or written, shall represent that animal.</p>

<p>Take another example. Place the living animal called
man before them. Less trouble will be found in this case
than in the former, for there is a nearer agreement than before
in regard to the signs which shall be employed to express
the idea. This word occurs with very little variation
in the modern languages, derived undoubtedly from the Teutonic,
with a little change in the spelling, as Saxon <i>mann</i> or
<i>mon</i>, Gothic <i>manna</i>, German, Danish,
Dutch, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sweedish'">Swedish</ins> and
Icelandic like ours. In the south of Europe, however, this
word varies as well as others.</p>

<p>Our language is derived more directly from the old Saxon
than from any other, but has a great similarity to the
French and Latin, and a kind of cousin-german to all the
languages of Europe, ancient and modern. Ours, indeed,
is a compound from most other languages, retaining some of
their beauties and many of their defects. We can boast little
distinctive character of our own. As England was possessed
by different nations at different periods, so different
dialects were introduced, and we can trace our language to
as many sources, German, Danish, Saxon, French, and
Roman, which were the different nations amalgamated
into the British empire. We retain little of the real old
english&mdash;few words which may not be traced to a foreign
extraction. Different people settling in a country would of
course carry their ideas and manner of expressing them;
and from the whole compound a general agreement would,
in process of time, take place, and a uniform language be
established. Such is the origin and condition of our
lan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>guage,
as well as every other modern tongue of which we
have any knowledge.</p>

<p>There is one practice of which our savans are guilty, at
which I do most seriously demur&mdash;the extravagant introduction
of exotic words into our vocabulary, apparently for
no other object than to swell the size of a dictionary, and
boast of having found out and defined thousands of words
more than any body else. A mania seems to have seized
our lexicographers, so that they have forsaken the good old
style of "plainness of speech," and are flourishing and
brandishing about in a cloud of verbiage as though the
whole end of instruction was to teach loquacity. And some
of our popular writers and speakers have caught the infection,
and flourish in borrowed garments, prizing themselves
most highly when they use words and phrases which no
body can understand.</p>

<p>I will not contend that in the advancement of the arts
and sciences it may not be proper to introduce foreign terms
as the mean of conveying a knowledge of those improvements
to others. It is better than to coin new words, inasmuch
as they are generally adopted by all modern nations.
In this way all languages are approximating together; and
when the light of truth, science, and religion, has fully
shone on all the nations, we may hope one language will
be spoken, and the promise be fulfilled, that God has "turned
unto the people a pure language, that they may call upon
the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent."</p>

<p>New ideas are formed like new inventions. Established
principles are employed in a new combination, so as to produce
a new manifestation. Words are chosen as nearly
allied to former ideas as possible, to express or represent
this new combination. Thus, Fulton applied steam power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to navigation. A new idea was produced. A boat was
seen passing along the waters without the aid of wind or
tide. Instead of coining a new word to express the whole,
a word which nobody would understand, two old ones
were combined, and "<i>steamboat</i>" became the sign to represent
the idea of the thing beheld. So with rail-road, cotton-mill,
and gun-powder. In the same way we may account
for most words employed in science, although in that
case we are more dependant on foreign languages, in
as much as a large portion of our knowledge is derived
from them. But we may account for them on the same
principle as above. <i>Phrenology</i> is a compound of two
greek words, and means the science or knowledge of the
mind. So of geology, mineralogy, &amp;c. But when
improvements are made by those who speak the english,
words in our own language are employed and used not only
by ourselves, but also by those nations who profit by our
investigations.</p>

<p>I trust I have now said enough on the general principles
of language as applied to things. In the next lecture I will
come down to a sort of bird's eye view of grammar. But
my soul abhors arbitrary rules so devoutly, I can make no
promises how long I will continue in close communion with
set forms of speech. I love to wander too well to remain
confined to one spot, narrowed up in the limits fixed by
others. Freedom is the empire of the mind; it abjures
all fetters, all slavery. It kneels at the altar of virtue and
worships at the shrine of truth. No obstacles should be
thrown in the way of its progress. No limits should be set
to it but those of the Almighty.</p>

<p>Your attention is, this evening, invited to the first divisions
of words, called <i>Nouns</i>. This is a most important class, and
as such deserves our particular notice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Nouns are the names of things.</i></p></div>

<p>The word <i>noun</i> is derived from the Latin <i>nomen</i>, French
<i>nom</i>. It means <i>name</i>. Hence the definition above given.</p>

<p>In grammar it is employed to distinguish that class of
words which name things, or stand as signs or representatives
of things.</p>

<p>We use the word <i>thing</i> in its broadest sense, including
every possible entity; every being, or thing, animate or inanimate,
material or immaterial, real or imaginary, physical,
moral, or intellectual. It is the noun of the Saxon
<i>thincan</i> or <i>thingian</i>, to think; and is used to express every
conceivable object of thought, in whatever form or manner
presented to the human mind.</p>

<p>Every word employed to designate things, or name them,
is to be ranked in the class called <i>nouns</i>, or names. You
have only to determine whether a word is used thus, to learn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
whether it belongs to this or some other class of words.
Here let me repeat:</p>


<ul><li>1. Things exist.</li>
<li>2. We conceive ideas of things.</li>
<li>3. We use sounds or signs to communicate these ideas to others.</li>
<li>4. We denominate the class of words thus used, <i>nouns</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps I ought to stop here, or pass to another topic.
But as these lectures are intended to be so plain that all
can understand my meaning, I must indulge in a few more
remarks before advancing farther.</p>

<p>In addition to individual, tangible objects, we conceive
ideas of the <i>qualities</i> of things, and give <i>names</i> to such
qualities, which become <i>nouns</i>. Thus, the <i>hardness</i> of iron, the
<i>heat</i> of fire, the <i>color</i> of a rose, the <i>bitterness</i> of gall,
the <i>error</i> of grammars. The following may serve to make my
views more plain. Take two tumblers, the one half filled
with water, the other with milk; mix them together. You
can now talk of the milk in the water, or the water in the
milk. Your ideas are distinct, tho the objects are so intimately
blended, that they can not be separated. So with
the qualities of things.</p>

<p>We also speak of mind, intellect, soul; but to them we
can give no form, and of them paint no likeness. Yet we
have ideas of them, and employ words to express them,
which become <i>nouns</i>.</p>

<p>This accounts for the reason why the great Parent Intellect
has strictly forbidden, in the decalogue, that a likeness
of him should be constructed. His being and attributes are
discoverable only thro the medium of his works and word.
No man can see him and live. It would be the height of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
folly&mdash;it would be more&mdash;it would be blasphemy&mdash;to attempt
to paint the likeness of him whose presence fills
immensity&mdash;whose center is every where, and whose
circumference is no where. The name of this Spirit or Being
was held in the most profound reverence by the Jews, as
we shall have occasion to mention when we come to treat
of the verb <span class="smcap">to be</span>.</p>

<p>We talk of angels, and have seen the unhallowed attempt
to describe their likeness in the form of pictures, which display
the fancy of the artist very finely, but give a miserable
idea of those pure spirits who minister at the altar of
God, and chant his praises in notes of the most unspeakable
delight.</p>

<p>We have also seen <i>death</i> and the pale horse, the firy
dragon, the mystery of Babylon, and such like things,
represented on canvass; but they betoken more of human
talent to depict the marvellous, than a strict regard for truth.
Beelzebub, imps, and all Pandemonium, may be vividly
imagined and finely arranged in fiction, and we can name
them. Wizzards, witches, and fairies, may play their sportive
tricks in the human brain, and receive names as tho they
were real.</p>

<p>We also think and speak of the qualities and affections
of the mind as well as matter, as wisdom, knowledge, virtue,
vice, love, hatred, anger. Our conceptions in this case
may be less distinct, but we have ideas, and use words to
express them. There is, we confess, a greater liability to
mistake and misunderstand when treating of mind and its
qualities, than of matter. The reason is evident, people
know less of it. Its operations are less distinct and more
varying.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The child first sees material objects. It is taught to
name them. It next learns the qualities of things; as the
sweetness of sugar, the darkness of night, the beauty of
flowers. From this it ascends by gradation to the higher
attainments of knowledge as revealed in the empire of mind,
as well as matter. Great care should be taken that this
advancement be easy, natural, and thoro. It should be
constantly impressed with the importance of obtaining clear
and definite ideas of things, and never employ words till
it has ideas to express; never name a thing of which it has
no knowledge. This is ignorance.</p>

<p>It would be well, perhaps, to extend this remark to those
older than children, in years, but less in real practical
knowledge. The remark is of such general application, that no
specification need be made, except to the case before us;
to those affected proficients in grammar, whose only knowledge
is the memory of words, which to them have no meanings,
if, indeed, the writers themselves had any to express
by them; a fact we regard as questionable, at best. There
is hardly a teacher of grammar, whose self-esteem is not
enormous, who will not confess himself ignorant on many of
the important principles of language; that he has never
understood, and could never explain them. He finds no difficulty
in repeating what the books say, but if called upon to
express an opinion of his own, he has none to give. He has
learned and used words without knowing their meaning.</p>

<p>Children should be taught language as they are taught
music. They should learn the simple tones on which the
whole science depends. Distinct impressions of sounds
should be made on their minds, and the characters which
represent them should be inseparably associated with them.
They will then learn tunes from the compositions of those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sounds, as represented by notes. By dint of application,
they will soon become familiar with these principles, if
possessed of a talent for song, and may soon pass the acme with
ease, accuracy, and rapidity. But there are those who may
sing very prettily, and tolerably correct, who have never
studied the first rudiments of music. But such can never
become adepts in the science.</p>

<p>So there are those who use language correctly, who never
saw the inside of a grammar book, and who never examined
the principles on which it depends. But this, by no
means, proves that it is better to sing by rote, than "with
the understanding." These rudiments, however, should
form the business of the nursery, rather than the grammar
school. Every mother should labor to give distinct and
forcible impressions of such things as she learns her children
to <i>name</i>. She should carefully prevent them from
employing words which have no meaning, and still more
strictly should she guard them against attaching a wrong
meaning to those they do use. In this way, the foundation
for future knowledge and eminence, would be laid broad and
deep. But I wander.</p>

<p>We attach names to imaginary things; as ghosts, genii,
imps.</p>

<p>To this class belong the thirty thousand gods of the ancients,
who were frequently represented by emblems significant
of the characters attached to them. We employ
words to name these imaginary things, so that we read and
converse about them understandingly, tho our ideas may be
exceedingly various.</p>

<p>Nouns are also used to express negation, of which no
idea can be formed. In this case, the mind rests on what
exists, and employs a word to express what does not. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
speak of <i>a hole</i> in the paper. But we can form no idea of
<i>a hole</i>, separated from the surrounding substances. Remove
the parts of the paper till nothing is left, and then you
may look in vain for the hole. It is not there. It never
was. In the same way we use the words nothing, nobody,
nonentity, vacuum, absence, space, blank, annihilation, and
oblivion. These are relative terms, to be understood in reference
to things which are known to exist. We must know
of <i>some</i>thing before we can talk of <i>no</i>thing, of an entity before
we can think of nonentity.</p>

<p>In a similar way we employ words to name actions, which
are produced by the changes of objects. We speak of a
race, of a flight, of a sitting or session, of a journey, of a
ride, of a walk, of a residence, etc. In all these cases, the
mind is fixed on the persons who performed these things.
Take for example, a race. Of that, we can conceive no
idea separate from the agent or object which <i>ran</i> the <i>race</i>.
Without some other word to inform us we could not decide
whether a <i>horse</i> race, a <i>foot</i> race, a boat race, the race of
a mill, or some other race, was the object of remark. The
same may be said of flight, for we read of the flight of birds,
the flight of Mahommed, the flight of armies, and the flight
of intellect.</p>

<p>We also give names to actions as tho they were taking
place in the present tense. "The <i>reading</i> of the report
was deferred;" steamboat <i>racing</i> is dangerous to public
safety; <i>stealing</i> is a crime; false <i>teaching</i> deserves the
reprobation of all.</p>

<p>The hints I have given will assist you in acquiring a
knowledge of nouns as used to express ideas in vocal or
written language. This subject might be pursued further
with profit, if time would permit. As the time allotted to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
this lecture is nearly exhausted, I forbear. I shall hereafter
have occasion to show how a whole phrase may be
used to name an idea, and as such stand as the agent or
object of a verb.</p>

<p>Some nouns are specifically used to designate certain objects,
and distinguish them from the class to which they
usually belong. In this way they assume a distinctive
character, and are usually denominated <span class="smcap">proper nouns</span>.
They apply to persons, places and things; as, John Smith,
Boston, Hylax. <i>Boy</i> is applied in common to all young
males of the human species, and as such is a <i>common noun</i>
or name. <i>John Smith</i> designates a particular boy from the
rest.</p>

<p>Proper names may be also applied to animals and things.
The stable keeper and stageman has a name for every
horse he owns, to distinguish it from other horses; the dairyman
for his cows, the boy for his dog, and the girl for
her doll. Any word, in fact, may become a proper name
by being specifically used; as the ship Fair Trader, the
brig Success, sloop Delight in Peace, the race horse Eclipse,
Black Hawk, Round Nose, and Red Jacket.</p>

<p>Proper names were formerly used in reference to certain
traits of character or circumstances connected with the place
or thing. <i>Abram</i> was changed to <i>Abraham</i>, the former
signifying <i>an elevated father</i>, the latter, <i>the father of a multitude</i>.
<i>Isaac</i> signified <i>laughter</i>, and was given because his
mother laughed at the message of the angel. <i>Jacob</i> signified
<i>a supplanter</i>, because he was to obtain the birthright
of his elder brother.</p>

<p>A ridiculous rage obtained with our puritan fathers to
express scripture sentiments in the names of their children,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
as may be seen by consulting the records of the Plymouth
and Massachusetts colonies.</p>

<p>This practice has not wholly gone out of use in our day,
for we hear of the names of Hope, Mercy, Patience, Comfort,
Experience, Temperance, Faith, Deliverance, Return, and
such like, applied usually to females, (being more in character
probably,) and sometimes to males. We have also
the names of White, Black, Green, Red, Gray, Brown, Olive,
Whitefield, Blackwood, Redfield, Woodhouse, Stonehouse,
Waterhouse, Woodbridge, Swiftwater, Lowater,
Drinkwater, Spring, Brooks, Rivers, Pond, Lake, Fairweather,
Merryweather, Weatherhead, Rice, Wheat, Straw,
Greatrakes, Bird, Fowle, Crow, Hawks, Eagle, Partridge,
Wren, Goslings, Fox, Camel, Zebra, Bear, Wolf, Hogg,
Rain, Snow, Haile, Frost, Fogg, Mudd, Clay, Sands, Hills,
Valley, Field, Stone, Flint, Silver, Gould, and Diamond.</p>

<p>Proper nouns may also become common when used as
words of general import; as, <i>dunces</i>, corrupted from Duns
Scotus, a distinguished theologian, born at Dunstane, Northumberland,
an opposer of the doctrines of Thomas Aquinus.
He is a real <i>solomon</i>, jack tars, judases, antichrist,
and so on.</p>

<p>Nouns may also be considered in respect to person, number,
gender, and positive, or case. There are <i>three</i> persons,
<i>two</i> numbers, <i>two</i> genders, and <i>two</i> cases. But the
further consideration of these things will be deferred, which,
together with Pronouns, will form the subject of our next
lecture.</p>

<p>We resume the consideration of nouns this evening, in
relation to person, number, gender, and position or case.</p>

<p>In the use of language there is a speaker, person spoken
to, and things spoken of. Those who speak are the <i>first</i>
persons, those who hear the <i>second</i>, and those who are the
subject of conversation the <i>third</i>.</p>

<p>The first and second persons are generally used in reference
to human beings capable of speech and understanding.
But we sometimes condesend to hold converse with animals
and inanimate matter. The bird trainer talks to his parrots,
the coachman to his horses, the sailor to the winds,
and the poet to his landscapes, towers, and wild imaginings,
to which he gives a "local habitation and a name."</p>

<p>By metaphor, language is put into the mouths of animals,
particularly in fables. By a still further license, places
and things, flowers, trees, forests, brooks, lakes, mountains,
towers, castles, stars, &amp;c. are made to speak the most
eloquent language, in the first person, in addresses the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pathetic. The propriety of such a use of words I will not
stop to question, but simply remark that such figures should
never be employed in the instruction of children. As the
mind expands, no longer content to grovel amidst mundane
things, we mount the pegasus of imagination and soar thro
the blissful or terrific scenes of fancy and fiction, and study
a language before unknown. But it would be an unrighteous
demand upon others, to require them to understand us;
and quite as unpardonable to brand them with ignorance
because they do not.</p>

<p>Most nouns are in the third person. More things are
talked about than talk themselves, or are talked to by others.
Hence there is little necessity for teaching children
to specify except in the first or second person, which is
very easily done.</p>

<p>In English there are two <i>numbers</i>, singular and plural.
The singular is confined to one, the plural is extended to
any indefinite number. The Greeks, adopted a dual number
which they used to express two objects united in pairs,
or couples; as, a span of horses, a yoke of oxen, a brace
of pistols, a pair of shoes. We express the same idea with
more words, using the singular to represent the union of the
two. We also extend this use of words and employ what
are called <i>nouns of multitude</i>; as, a people, an army, a
host, a nation. These and similar words are used in the
singular referring to many combined in a united whole, or
in the plural comprehending a diversity; as, "the armies
met," "the nations are at peace." <i>People</i> admits no change
on account of number. We say "<i>many</i> people are collected
together and form <i>a</i> numerous people."</p>

<p>The plural is not always to be understood as expressing
an increase of number, but of qualities or sorts of things, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the merchant has a variety of <i>sugars</i>, <i>wines</i>, <i>teas</i>, <i>drugs</i>,
<i>medicines</i>, <i>paints</i> and <i>dye-woods</i>. We also speak of <i>hopes</i>,
<i>fears</i>, <i>loves</i>, <i>anxieties</i>.</p>

<p>Some nouns admit of no plural, in fact, or in use; as,
chaos, universe, fitness, immortality, immensity, eternity.
Others admit of no singular; as, scissors, tongs, vitals, molasses.
These words probably once had singulars, but having
no use for them they became obsolete. We have long
been accustomed to associate the two halves of shears together,
so that in speaking of one whole, we say shears, and
of apart, half of a shears. But of some words originally,
and in fact plural, we have formed a singular; as, "one
twin died, and, tho the other one survived its dangerous
illness, the mother wept bitterly for her twins." <i>Twin</i> is
composed of <i>two</i> and <i>one</i>. It is found in old books, spelled
<i>twane</i>, two-one, or twin. Thus, the <i>twi</i>-light is formed by
the mingling of two lights, or the division of the rays of light
by the approaching or receding darkness. They <i>twain</i>
shall be one flesh. Sheep and deer are singular or plural.</p>

<p>Most plurals are formed by adding <i>s</i> to the singular, or,
when euphony requires it, <i>es</i>; as, tree, trees; sun, suns; dish,
dishes; box, boxes. Some retain the old plural form; as,
ox, oxen; child, children; chick, chicken; kit, kitten. But
habit has burst the barrier of old rules, and we now talk of
chicks and chickens, kits and kittens. <i>Oxen</i> alone stands
as a monument raised to the memory of unaltered saxon
plurals.</p>

<p>Some nouns form irregular plurals. Those ending in <i>f</i>
change that letter to <i>v</i> and then add <i>es</i>; as, half, halves;
leaf, leaves; wolf, wolves. Those ending in <i>y</i> change that
to <i>i</i> and add the <i>es</i>; as, cherry, cherries; berry, berries;
except when the <i>y</i> is preceded by a vowel, in which case it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
only adds the <i>s</i>; as, day, days; money, moneys (not <i>ies</i>);
attorney, attorneys. All this is to make the sound more
easy and harmonious. <i>F</i> and <i>v</i> were formerly used indiscriminately,
in singulars as well as plurals, and, in fact, in
the composition of all words where they occurred. The
same may be said of <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And an the aultar layde."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reason why <i>y</i> is changed into <i>i</i> in the formation of
plurals, and in certain other cases, is, I apprehend, accounted
for from the fact that words which now end in <i>y</i> formerly
ended in <i>ie</i>, as may be seen in all old books. The regular
plural was then formed by adding <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>"And upon those members of the <i>bodie</i>, which <i>wee</i> thinke
most unhonest, put <i>wee</i> more honestie on." "It rejoyceth
not in iniquitie&mdash;diversitie of gifts&mdash;all thinges edifie not."
See old bible, 1 Cor., chap. 13 and 14.</p>

<p>Other words form their plurals still more differently, for
which no other rule than habit can be given; as, man, men;
foot, feet; tooth, teeth; die, dice; mouse, mice; penny,
pence, and sometimes pennies, when applied to distinct
pieces of money, and not to value.</p>

<p>Many foreign nouns retain the plural form as used by the
nations from whom we have borrowed them; as, cherub,
cherubim; seraph, seraphim; radius, radii; memorandum,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
memoranda; datum, data, &amp;c. We should be pleased to
have such words carried home, or, if they are ours by virtue
of possession, let them be adopted into our family, and
put on the garments of naturalized citizens, and no longer
appear as lonely strangers among us. There is great aukwardness
in adding the english to the hebrew plural of
cherub, as the translators of the common version of the
bible have done. They use <i>cherub</i> in the singular and
cherub<i>ims</i> in the plural. The <i>s</i> should be omitted and the
Hebrew plural retained, or the preferable course adopted,
and the final <i>s</i> be added, making cherubs, seraphs, &amp;c.
The same might be said of all foreign nouns. It would add
much to the regularity, dignity, and beauty, of our vernacular
tongue.</p>

<p>Proper nouns admit of the plural number; as, there are
sixty-four John Smiths in New-York, twenty Arnolds in
Providence, and fifteen Davises in Boston. As we are not
accustomed to form the plurals of proper names there is
not that ease and harmony in the first use of them that we
have found in those with which we are more familiar; especially
those we have rarely heard pronounced. Habit
surmounts the greatest obstacles and makes things the most
harsh and unpleasant appear soft and agreeable.</p>

<p>Gender is applied to the distinction of the sexes. There
are two&mdash;masculine and feminine. The former is applied to
males, the latter to females. Those words which belong to
neither gender, have been called <i>neuter</i>, that is, <i>no gender</i>.
But it is hardly necessary to perplex the minds of learners
with <i>negatives</i>. Let them distinguish between masculine
and feminine genders, and little need be said to them about
a <i>neuter</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
There are some nouns of both genders, as student, writer,
pupil, person, citizen, resident. <i>Poet</i>, <i>author</i>, editor, and
some other words, have of late been applied to females, instead
of poet<i>ess</i>, author<i>ess</i>, edit<i>ress</i>. Fashion will soon
preclude the necessity of this former distinction.</p>

<p>Some languages determine their genders by the form of
the endings of their nouns, and what is thus made masculine
in Rome, may be feminine in France. It is owing, no doubt,
to this practice, in other nations, that we have attached the
idea of gender to inanimate things; as, "the sun, <i>he</i> shines
majestically;" while of the moon, it is said, "<i>she</i> sheds a
milder radiance." But we can not coincide with the reason
assigned by Mr. Murray, for this distinction. His notion
is not valid. It does not correspond with facts. While
in the south of Europe the sun is called masculine and the
moon feminine, the northern nations invariably reverse the
distinction, particularly the dialects of the Scandinavian. It
was so in our own language in the time of Shakspeare. He
calls the sun a "<i>fair wench</i>."</p>

<p>By figures of rhetoric, genders may be attached to inanimate
matter. Where things are personified, we usually
speak of them as masculine and feminine; but this practice
depends on fancy, and not on any fixed rules. There is, in
truth, but two genders, and those confined to animals. When
we break these rules, and follow the undirected wanderings
of fancy, we can form no rules to regulate our words. We
may have as many fanciful ones as we please, but they will
not apply in common practice. For example: poets and
artists have usually attached female loveliness to angels,
and placed them in the feminine gender. But they are invariably
used in the masculine thro out the scriptures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
There is an apparent absurdity in saying of the ship
General Williams, <i>she</i> is beautiful; or, of the steamboat
Benjamin Franklin, <i>she</i> is out of date. It were far better
to use no gender in such cases. But if people will continue
the practice of making distinctions where there are none,
they must do it from habit and whim, and not from any reason
or propriety.</p>

<p>There are three ways in which we usually distinguish
the forms of words in reference to gender. 1st. By words
which are different; as boy, girl; uncle, aunt; father, mother.
2d. By a different termination of the same word; as instructor,
instructress; lion, lioness; poet, poetess. <i>Ess</i> is
a contraction from the hebrew <i>essa</i>, a female. 3d. By
prefixing another word; as, a male child, a female child;
a man servant, a maid servant; a he-goat, a she-goat.</p>

<p>The last consideration that attaches to nouns, is the <i>position</i>
they occupy in written or spoken language, in relation
to other words, as being <i>agents</i>, or <i>objects</i> of action. This
is termed <i>position</i>.</p>

<p>There are two positions in which nouns stand in reference
to their meaning and use. First, as <i>agents</i> of action, as
<i>David</i> killed <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Goliah'">Goliath</ins>.
Second, as <i>objects</i> on which action
terminates; as, <i>Richard</i> conquered <i>Henry</i>. These two distinctions
should be observed in the use of all nouns. But
the propriety of this division will be more evident when we
come to treat of verbs, their agents and objects.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that we have abandoned the use of
the "<i>possessive case</i>," a distinction which has been insisted
on in our grammars; and also changed the names of the
other two. As we would adopt nothing that is new without
first being convinced that something is needed which the
thing proposed will supply; so we would reject nothing that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
is old, till we have found it useless and cumbersome. It
will be admitted on all hands that the fewer and simpler the
rules of grammar, the more readily will they be understood,
and the more correctly applied. We should guard, on the
one hand, against having so many as to perplex, and on the
other, retain enough to apply in the correct use of language.
It is on this ground that we have proposed an improvement
in the names and number of cases, or positions.</p>

<p>The word noun signifies name, and <i>nominative</i> is the adjective
derived from noun, and partakes of the same meaning.
Hence the <i>nominative</i> or <i>naming</i> case may apply as
correctly to the object as the agent. "<i>John</i> strikes <i>Thomas</i>,
and <i>Thomas</i> strikes <i>John</i>." John and Thomas name
the boys who strike, but in the first case John is the actor
or agent and Thomas the object. In the latter it is changed.
To use a <i>nominative name</i> is a redundancy which should
be avoided. You will understand my meaning and see the
propriety of the change proposed, as the mind of the learner
should not be burthened with needless or irrelevant phrases.</p>

<p>But our main objection lies against the "possessive case."
We regard it as a false and unnecessary distinction. What
is the possessive case? Murray defines it as "expressing
the relation of property or possession; as, my father's
house." His rule of syntax is, "one substantive governs
another, signifying a different thing, in the possessive or
genitive case; as, my father's house." I desire you to understand
the definition and use as here given. Read it over
again, and be careful that you know the meaning of <i>property</i>,
<i>possession</i>, and <i>government</i>. Now let a scholar parse
correctly the example given. "<i>Father's</i>" is a common
noun, third person, singular number, masculine gender, and
<i>governed</i> by house:" Rule, "One noun <i>governs</i> another,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
&amp;c. Then my father does not govern his own house, but
his house him! What must be the conduct and condition of
the family, if they have usurped the government of their
head? "John Jones, hatter, keeps constantly for sale all
kinds of <i>boy's hats</i>. Parse boy's. It is a noun, possessive
case, <i>governed</i> by hats." What is the possessive case?
It "signifies the <i>relation of property or possession</i>." Do the
hats belong to the boys? Oh no. Are they the <i>property</i>
or in the <i>possession</i> of the boys? Certainly not. Then
what relation is there of property or possession? None at
all. They belong to John Jones, were made by him, are
his property, and by him are advertised for sale. He has
used the word <i>boy's</i> to distinguish their size, quality, and
fitness for boy's use.</p>

<p>"The master's slave." Master's is in the possessive
case, and <i>governed</i> by slave! If grammars are true there
can be no need of abolition societies, unless it is to look
after the master and see that he is not abused. The rider's
horse; the captain's ship; the general's army; the governor's
cat; the king's subject. How false it would be to
teach scholars the idea of <i>property</i> and <i>government</i> in such
cases. The <i>teacher's scholars</i> should never learn that by
virtue of their grammars, or the <i>apostrophe</i> and letter <i>s</i>,
they have a right to <i>govern</i> their teachers; nor the mother's
son, to govern his mother. Our merchants would dislike
exceedingly to have the <i>ladies</i> understand them to
signify by their advertisements that the "ladies' merino
shawls, the ladies's bonnets and lace wrought veils, the ladies'
gloves and elegant Thibet, silk and challa dresses,
were the <i>property</i> of the ladies; for in that case they might
claim or <i>possess</i> themselves of their <i>property</i>, and no longer
trouble the merchant with the care of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
"Peter's wife's mother lay sick of a fever." "<i>His</i> physician
said that <i>his</i> disease would require <i>his</i> utmost skill to
defeat <i>its</i> progress in <i>his</i> limbs." Phrases like these are
constantly occurring, which can not be explained intelligibly
by the existing grammars. In fact, the words said to be
nouns in the possessive case, have changed their character,
by use, from nouns to adjectives, or definitive words, and
should thus be classed. Russia iron, Holland gin, China
ware, American people, the Washington tavern, Lafayette
house, Astor house, Hudson river, (formerly Hudson's,)
Baffin's bay, Van Dieman's land, John street, Harper's ferry,
Hill's bridge, a paper book, a bound book, a red book,
John's book&mdash;one which John is known to use, it may be
a borrowed one, but generally known as some way connected
with him,&mdash;Rev. Mr. Smith's church, St. John's
church, Grace church, Murray's grammar; not the property
nor in the possession of Lindley Murray, neither does it
<i>govern him</i>; for he has gone to speak a purer language
than he taught on earth. It is mine. I bought it, have
possessed it these ten years; but, thank fortune, am little
<i>governed</i> by it. But more on this point when we come to
the proper place. What I have said, will serve as a hint,
which will enable you to see the impropriety of adopting the
"possessive case."</p>

<p>It may be said that more cases are employed in other
languages. That is a poor reason why we should break
the barriers of natural language. Beside, I know not how
we should decide by that rule, for none of them have a <i>case</i>
that will compare with the English possessive. The genitive
of the French, Latin, or Greek, will apply in only a
few respects. The former has <i>three</i>, the latter five, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Latin six cases, neither of which correspond with the possessive,
as explained by Murray and his satellites. We
should be slow to adopt into our language an idiom which
does not belong to it, and compel learners to make distinctions
where none exist. It is an easy matter to tell children
that the apostrophe and letter <i>s</i> marks the possessive
case; but when they ask the difference in the meaning between
the use of the noun and those which all admit are adjectives,
it will be no indifferent task to satisfy them. What
is the difference in the construction of language or the sense
conveyed, between Hudson'<i>s</i> river, and <i>Hudson</i> river? Davis's
straits, or Bass straits? St. John's church, or Episcopal
church? the sun's beams, or sun shine? In all cases
these words are used to define the succeeding noun. They
regard "property or possession," only when attending circumstances,
altogether foreign from any quality in the form
or meaning of the word itself, are so combined as to give it
that import. And in such cases, we retain these words as
adjectives, long after the property has passed from the hands
of the persons who gave it a name. <i>Field's</i> point, <i>Fuller's</i>
rocks, <i>Fisher's</i> island, <i>Fulton's</i> invention, will long be retained
after those whose names were given to distinguish
these things, have slept with their fathers and been forgotten.
Blannerhassett's Island, long since ceased to be his
property or tranquil possession, by confiscation; but it will
retain its specific name, till the inundations of the Ohio's
waters shall have washed it away and left not a wreck behind.</p>

<p>The distinctions I have made in the positions of nouns,
will be clearly understood when we come to the verbs. A
few remarks upon pronouns will close the present lecture.</p>

<h4>PRONOUNS.</h4>

<p>Pronouns are such as the word indicates. <i>Pro</i> is the
latin word <i>for</i>; pro-nomen, <i>for nouns</i>. They are words,
originally nouns, used specifically <i>for</i> other nouns, to avoid
the too frequent repetition of the same words; as, Washington
was the father of his country; <i>he</i> was a valiant officer.
<i>We</i> ought to respect <i>him</i>. The word <i>we</i>, stands for the
speaker and all present, and saves the trouble of naming
them; <i>he</i> and <i>him</i>, stand for Washington, to avoid the monotony
which would be produced by a recurrence of his
name.</p>

<p>Pronouns are all of one kind, and few in number. I will
give you a list of them in their respective positions.</p>

<p>The two last may be used in either person, number, or
gender.</p>

<p>The frequent use of these words render them very important,
in the elegant and rapid use of language. They
are so short, and their sound so soft and easy, that the frequency
of their recurrence does not mar the beauty of a sentence,
but saves us from the redundancy of other words.
They are substituted only when there is little danger of
mistaking the nouns for which they stand. They are, however,
sometimes used in a very broad sense; as, "<i>they say</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it is so;" meaning no particular persons, but the general
sentiment. <i>It</i> frequently takes the lead of a sentence, and
the thing represented by it comes after; as, "It is currently
reported, that things were thus and so." Here <i>it</i> represents
the single idea which is afterward stated at length. "<i>It</i> is
so." "<i>It</i> may be that the nations will be destroyed by
wars, earthquakes, and famines." But more of this when
we come to speak of the composition of sentences.</p>

<p>The words now classed as pronouns were originally
<i>names</i> of things, but in this character they have long been
obsolete. They are now used only in their secondary
character as the representatives of other words. The word
<i>he</i>, for instance, signified originally <i>to breathe</i>. It was applied
to the living beings who inhaled air. It occurs with
little change in the various languages of Europe, ancient
and modern, till at length it is applied to the male agent
which lives and acts. The word <i>her</i> means <i>light</i>, but is
specifically applied to females which are the objects of action.</p>

<p>Was it in accordance with the design of these lectures, it
would give me pleasure to go into a minute examination of
the origin, changes and meaning of these words till they
came to be applied as specific words of exceeding limited
character. Most of them might be traced thro all the languages
of Europe; the Arabic, Persic, Arminian, Chaldean,
Hebrew, and, for ought I know, all the languages of
Asia. But as they are now admitted a peculiar position in
the expression of thought from which they never vary; and
as we are contending about philosophic principles rather
than verbal criticisms, I shall forbear a further consideration
of these words.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
In the proper place I shall consider those words formerly
called "Adjective Pronouns," "Pronoun Adjectives," or
"Pronominal Adjectives," to suit the varying whims of those
grammar makers, who desired to show off a speck of improvement
in their "simplifying" works without ever having
a new idea to express. It is a query in some minds
whether the seventy-two "simplifiers" and "improvers"
of Murray's grammar ever had any distinct notions in their
heads which they did not obtain from the very man, who,
it would seem by their conduct, was unable to explain his
own meaning.</p>

<p>The most important sub-division of words is the class
called Adjectives, which we propose to notice this evening.
<i>Adjective</i> signifies <i>added</i> or <i>joined to</i>. We employ the term
in grammar to designate that class of words which are
<i>added to nouns to define or describe them</i>. In doing this, we
strictly adhere to the principles we have already advanced,
and do not deviate from the laws of nature, as developed in
the regulation of speech.</p>

<p>In speaking of things, we had occasion to observe that
the mind not only conceived ideas of things, but of their
properties; as, the hardness of flint; the heat of fire; and
that we spoke of one thing in reference to another. We
come now to consider this subject more at large.</p>

<p>In the use of language the mind first rests on the thing
which is present before it, or the word which represents the
idea of that thing. Next it observes the changes and attitudes
of these things. Thirdly, it conceives ideas of their
qualities and relations to other things. The first use of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
these words is to name things. This we call <i>nouns</i>. The
second is to express their actions. This we call <i>verbs</i>.
The last is to define or describe things. This we call <i>adjectives</i>.
There is a great similarity between the words
used to name things and to express their actions; as, builders
build buildings; singers sing songs; writers write writings;
painters paint paintings. In the popular use of language
we vary these words to avoid the monotony and give
pleasantness and variety. We say builders <i>erect</i> houses,
barns, and other buildings; singers perform pieces of music;
musicians play tunes; the choir sing psalm tunes;
artists paint pictures.</p>

<p>From these two classes a third is derived which partakes
somewhat of the nature of both, and yet from its secondary
use, it has obtained a distinctive character, and as such is
allowed a separate position among the classes of words.</p>

<p>It might perhaps appear more in order to pass the consideration
of adjectives till we have noticed the character and
use of verbs, from which an important portion of them is
derived. But as they are used in connexion with nouns, and
as the character they borrow from the verb will be readily
understood, I have preferred to retain the old arrangement,
and <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cosinder'">consider</ins>
them in this place.</p>

<p><i>Adjectives are words added to nouns to define or describe
them.</i> They are derived either, 1st, from nouns; as,
<i>window</i> glass, <i>glass</i> window, a stone house, building stone,
maple sugar, sugar cane; or, 2d, from verbs; as, a <i>written</i>
paper, a <i>printed</i> book, a <i>painted</i> house, a <i>writing</i> desk. In
the first case we employ one noun, or the name of one thing,
to define another, thus giving it a secondary use. A <i>glass</i>
window is one made of glass, and not of any thing else. It
is neither a <i>board</i> window, nor a <i>paper</i> window. <i>Maple</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sugar is not <i>cane</i> sugar, nor <i>beet</i> sugar, nor <i>molasses</i> sugar;
but it may be <i>brown</i> sugar, if it has been browned, or <i>white</i>
if it has been whit<i>ed</i> or whit<i>ened</i>. In this case, you at once
perceive the correctness of our second proposition, in the
derivation of adjectives from verbs, by which we describe
a thing in reference to its condition, in some way affected
by the operation of a prior action. A <i>printed</i> book is one
on which the action of printing has been performed. A
<i>written</i> book differs from the former, in as much as its appearance
was produced by writing and not by printing.</p>

<p>In the definition or description of things, whatever is best
understood is employed as a definitive or descriptive term,
and is attached to the object to make known its properties
and relations. Speaking of nations, if we desire to distinguish
some from others, we choose the words supposed to
be best known, and talk of European, African, American,
or Indian nations; northern, southern, eastern, or western
nations. These last words are used in reference to their
relative position, and may be variously understood; for we
speak of the northern, eastern, western, and southern nations
of Europe, of Africa, and the world.</p>

<p>Again, we read of civiliz<i>ed</i>, half-civilized, and barbarous
nations; learned, unlearned, ignorant, and enlightened; rich,
powerful, enterprising, respected, ancient or modern, christian,
mahomedan or pagan. In these, and a thousand similar
cases, we decide the meaning, not alone from the word
employed as an adjective, but from the subject of remark;
for, were we to attach the same meaning to the same word,
wherever used, we could not receive correct or definite impressions
from the language of others&mdash;our inferences would
be the most monstrous. A <i>great</i> mountain and a <i>great</i> pin,
a <i>great</i> continent and a <i>great</i> farm, a <i>great</i> ocean and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<i>great</i> pond, a <i>great</i> grammar and a <i>great</i> scholar, refer to
things of very different dimensions and character; or, as
Mr. Murray would say, "<i>qualities</i>." A mountain is great
by comparison with other mountains; and a pin, compared
with other pins, may be very large&mdash;exceeding great&mdash;and
yet fall very far short of the size of a very small mountain.
A <i>small</i> man may be a <i>great</i> scholar, and a rich neighbor
a poor friend. A sweet flower is often very bitter to the
taste. A <i>good</i> horse would make a <i>bad</i> dinner, but <i>false</i>
grammar can never make <i>true</i> philologists.</p>

<p>All words are to be understood according to their use.
Their meaning can be determined in no other way. Many
words change their forms to express their relations, but
fewer in our language than in most others, ancient or modern.
Other words remain the same, or nearly so, in every
position; noun, adjective, or verb, agent or object, past or
present. To determine whether a word is an adjective,
first ascertain whether it names a thing, defines or describes
it, or expresses its action, and you will never be at a loss to
know to what class it belongs.</p>

<p>The business of adjectives is twofold, and they may be
distinguished by the appellations of <i>defining</i> or <i>describing</i>
adjectives. This distinction is in many cases unimportant;
in others it is quite essential. The same word in one case
may <i>define</i>, in others <i>describe</i> the object, and occasionally
do both, for we often specify things by their descriptions.
The learner has only to ascertain the meaning and use of
the adjective to decide whether it defines or describes the
subject of remark. If it is employed to distinguish one
thing from the general mass, or one class from other classes,
it has the former character; but after such thing is pointed
out, if it is used to give a description of its character or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
properties, its character is different, and should be so understood
and explained.</p>

<p><i>Defining adjectives</i> are used to <i>point out</i>, specify or distinguish
certain things from others of their kind, or one sort
from other sorts, and answer to the questions <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>,
<i>how many</i>, or <i>how much</i>.</p>

<p><i>Describing adjectives</i> express the character and qualities
of things, and give a more full and distinct knowledge than
was before possessed.</p>

<p>In a case before mentioned, we spoke of the "Indian nations."
The word <i>Indian</i> was chosen to specify or define
what nations were alluded to. But all may not decide alike
in this case. Some may think we meant the aborigines of
America; others, that the southern nations of Asia were
referred to. This difficulty originates in a misapprehension
of the definitive word chosen. India was early known as
the name of the south part of Asia, and the people there,
were called Indians. When Columbus discovered the new
world, supposing he had reached the country of India, which
had long been sought by a voyage round the coast of Africa,
he named it India, and the people Indians. But when the
mistake was discovered, and the truth fully known, instead
of effecting a change in the name already very generally
understood, and in common use, another word was chosen
to distinguish between countries so opposite and <i>West</i> India
became the word to distinguish the newly discovered islands;
and as India was little better known in Europe at that
time, instead of retaining their old name unaltered, another
word was prefixed, and they called it <i>East</i> India. When,
therefore, we desire to be definite, we retain these words,
and say, East Indians and West Indians. Without this distinction,
we should understand the native people of our own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
country; but in Europe, Asia, and Africa, they would think
we alluded to those in Asia. So with all other adjectives
which are not understood. <i>Indian</i>, as an adjective, may
also be employed to <i>describe</i> the character and condition of
the aborigines. We talk of an indian temper, indian looks,
indian blankets, furs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In writing and conversation we should employ words to
explain, to define and describe, which are better understood
than those things of which we speak. The pedantry of
some modern writers in this respect is ridiculous. Not satisfied
to use plain terms which every body can understand,
they hunt the dictionaries from alpha to omega, and not
unfrequently overleap the "king's english," and ransack
other languages to find an unheard of word, or a list of adjectives
never before arranged together, in so nice a manner,
so that their ideas are lost to the common reader, if not
to themselves. This fault may be alleged against too many
of our public speakers, as well as the affected gentry of the
land. They are like Shakspeare's Gratiano, "who speaks
an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice;
his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels
of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them; and,
when you have found them, they are not worth the search."
Such sentences remind us of the painting of the young artist
who drew the form of an animal, but apprehensive that
some might mistake it, wrote under it, "<i>This is a horse.</i>"</p>

<p>In forming our notions of what is signified by an adjective,
the mind should pause to determine the meaning of
such word when used as a distinct name for some object, in
order to determine the import of it in this new capacity.
A <i>tallow</i> candle is one made of a substance called tallow,
and is employed to distinguish it from wax or spermaceti
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
candles. The adjective in this case, names the article of
which the candle is made, and is thus a noun, but, as we
are not speaking of tallow, but of candles, we place it in a
new relation, and give it a new grammatical character.
But you will perceive the correctness of a former assertion,
that all words may be reduced to two classes, and that adjectives
are derived from nouns or verbs.</p>

<p>But you may inquire if there are not some adjectives in
use which have no corresponding verb or noun from which
they are derived. There are many words in our language
which in certain uses have become obsolete, but are retained
in others. We now use some words as verbs which
originally were known only as nouns, and others as nouns
which are unknown as verbs. We also put a new construction
upon words and make nouns, verbs and adjectives
promiscuously and with little regard to rule or propriety.
Words at one time unknown become familiar by use, and
others are laid aside for those more new or fashionable.
These facts are so obvious that I shall be excused from extending
my remarks to any great length. But I will give
an example which will serve as a clew to the whole. Take
the word <i>happy</i>, long known only as an adjective. Instead
of following this word <i>back</i> to its primitive use and deriving
it directly from its noun, or as a past participle, such as it
is in truth, we have gone <i>forward</i> and made from it the
noun <i>happiness</i>, and, in more modern days, are using the
verb <i>happify</i>, a word, by the way, in common use, but
which has not yet been honored with a place in our dictionaries;
altho Mr. Webster has given us, as he says, the
<i>unauthorised</i> (un-author-ised) word "<i>happifying</i>." Perhaps
he had never heard or read some of our greatest
sa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>vans,
who, if not the authors, employ the word <i>happify</i> very
frequently in the pulpit and halls of legislation, and at the
bar, as well as in common parlance.</p>

<p><i>Happy</i> is the past participle of the verb <i>to hap</i>, or, as afterwards
used, with a nice shade of change in the meaning,
<i>to happen</i>. It means <i>happied</i>, or made happy by those favorable
circumstances which have <i>happened</i> to us. Whoever
will read our old writers no further back than Shakspeare,
will at once see the use and changes of this word.
They will find it in all its forms, simple and compound, as
a verb, noun, and adjective. "It may <i>hap</i> that he will
come." It happened as I was going that I found my lost
child, and was thereby made quite happy. The man desired
to <i>hap</i>pify himself and family without much labor, so
he engaged in speculation; and <i>hap</i>pily he was not so <i>hap</i>less
in his pursuit of <i>hap</i>piness as often <i>hap</i>pens to such
<i>hap</i>-hazard fellows, for he soon became very <i>hap</i>py with a
moderate fortune.</p>

<p>But to the question. There are many adjectives in our
language which are borrowed from foreign words. Instead
of <i>adjectiving</i> our own nouns we go to our neighbors and
<i>adjective</i> and anglicise [english-ise] their words, and adopt
the pampered urchins into our own family and call them
our favorites. It is no wonder that they often appear aukward
and unfamiliar, and that our children are slow in
forming an intimate acquaintance with them. You are
here favored with a short list of these words which will
serve as examples, and enable you to comprehend my
meaning and apply it in future use. Some of them are regularly
used as adjectives, with or without change; others
are not.</p>

that when we have no adjective of our own to correspond
with the noun, we borrow from our neighbors an

an english termination. For example:</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to understand the adjectives of
many nouns with which we are familiar, from the fact above
stated, that they are derived from other languages, and not
our own. The most thoro scholars have found this task no
easy affair. Most grammarians have let it pass unobserved;
but every person has seen the necessity of some explanation
upon this point, to afford a means of ascertaining the etymological
derivation and meaning of these words. I would
here enter farther into this subject, but I am reminded that
I am surpassing the limits set me for this course of lectures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The attention I have bestowed on this part of the present
subject, will not be construed into a mere verbal criticism.
It has been adopted to show you how, in the definition or
description of things, the mind clings to one thing to gain
some information concerning another. When we find a
thing unlike any thing else we have ever known, in form,
in size, in color, in every thing; we should find it a difficult
task, if not an impossibility, to describe it to another in a
way to give any correct idea of it. Having never seen its
like before, we can say little of its character. We may
give it a <i>name</i>, but that would not be understood. We
could say it was as large as&mdash;no, it had no size; that it
was like&mdash;but no, it had no likeness; that it resembled&mdash;no,
it had no resemblance. How could we describe it?
What could we say of it? Nothing at all.</p>

<p>What idea could the Pacha of Egypt form of ice, having
never seen any till the french chemists succeeded in freezing
water in his presence? They told him of ice; that it
was <i>cold</i>; that it would freeze; that whole streams were
often frozen over, so that men and teams could walk over
them. He believed no such thing&mdash;it was a "christian lie."
This idea was confirmed on the first trial of the chemists,
which failed of success. But when, on the second attempt,
they succeeded, he was all in raptures. A new field was
open before him. New ideas were produced in his mind.
New qualities were learned; and he could now form some
idea of the <i>ice</i> bergs of the north; of <i>frozen</i> regions, which
he had never seen; of <i>icy</i> hearts, and storms of <i>frozen</i> rain.</p>

<p>We often hear it said, such a man is very <i>stoical</i>; another
is an <i>epicurean</i>; and another is a <i>bacchanal</i>, or <i>bacchanalian</i>.
But what idea should we form of such persons,
if we had never read of the Stoics and their philosophy; of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Epicurus and his notions of happiness and duty; or of Bacchus,
the god of wine and revelry, whose annual feasts, or
Dionysia, were celebrated with the most extravagant licentiousness
thro out Greece and Rome, till put down by the
Senate of the latter.</p>

<p>You can not fail to see the importance of the knowledge
on which we here insist. The meaning you attach to words
is exceedingly diverse; and hence you are not always able
to think alike, or understand each other, nor derive the same
sentiment from the same language. The contradictory opinions
which exist in the world may be accounted for, in a
great measure, in this way. Our knowledge of many things
of which we speak, is limited, either from lack of means, or
disposition to employ them. People always differ and contend
most about things of which they know the least. Did
we all attach the same meaning to the same words, our
opinions would all be the same, as true as the forty-fifth
problem of Euclid. How important, then, that children
should always be taught the same meaning of words, and
learn to use them correctly. Etymology, viewed in this
light, is a most important branch of science.</p>

<p>Whenever a word is sufficiently understood, no adjective
should be connected with it. There is a ridiculous practice
among many people, of appending to every noun one or
more adjectives, which have no other effect than to expose
their own folly. Some writers are so in the habit of annexing
adjectives to all nouns, that they dare not use one
without. You will not unfrequently see adjectives different
in form, added to a noun of very similar meaning; as, sad
melancholy, an ominous sign, this mundane earth, pensive
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
When words can be obtained, which not only name the
object, but also describe its properties, it should be preferred
to a noun with an adjective; as <i>pirate</i>, for <i>sea robber</i>; <i>savan</i>,
for a <i>learned</i> or <i>wise
man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In relation to that class of adjectives derived from verbs,
we will be brief. They include what have been termed participles,
not a distinct "part of speech," but by some included
in the verbs. We use them as adjectives to describe things
as standing in some relation to other things on the account
of the action expressed by the verb from which they are
derived. "The man is respected." <i>Respected</i>, in this case,
describes the man in such a relation to those who have become
acquainted with his good qualities, that he now receives
their respect. He is respect<i>able</i>, (<i>able</i> to command,
or worthy of respect,) and of course, respected for his respectability.
To avoid repetition, we select different words
to assist in the expression of a complex idea. But I indulge
in phrases like the above, to show the nice shades of meaning
in the common use of words, endeavoring to analyze, as
far as possible, our words and thoughts, and show their mutual
connexion and dependencies.</p>

<p>What has been termed the "present participle" is also
an adjective, describing things in their present condition in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
reference to actions. "The man is writing." Here, <i>writing</i>
describes the man in his present employment. But the
consideration of this matter more properly belongs to the
construction of sentences.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>There is another class or variety of words properly belonging
to this division of grammar, which may as well be
noticed in this place as any other. I allude to those words
generally called "Prepositions." We have not time now
to consider them at large, but will give you a brief view of
our opinion of them, and reserve the remainder of our remarks
till we come to another part of these lectures.</p>

<p>Most of the words called prepositions, in books of grammar,
are participles, derived from verbs, many of which are
still in use, but some are obsolete. They are used in the
true character of adjectives, <i>describing one thing by its relation
to another</i>. But their meaning has not been generally
understood. Our dictionaries have afforded no means by
which we can trace their etymology. They have been regarded
as a kind of cement to stick other words together,
having no meaning or importance in
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Until
their meaning is known, we can not reasonably expect to
draw them from their hiding places, and give them a respectable
standing in the transmission of thought.</p>

<p>Many words, from the frequency of their use, fail to attract
our attention as much as those less employed; not because
they are less important, but because they are so
fa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>miliarly
known that the operations of thought are not observed
in the choice made of them to express ideas. If we
use words of which little is known, we ponder well before
we adopt them, to determine whether the sense usually attached
to them accords exactly with the notions we desire
to convey by them. The same can not be said of small
words which make up a large proportion of our language,
and are, in fact, more necessary than the others, in as much
as their meaning is more generally known. Those who employ
carriages to convey their bodies, observe little of their
construction, unless there is something singular or fine in
their appearance. The common parts are unobserved, yet
as important as the small words used in the common construction
of language, the vehicle of thought. As the apostle
says of the body politic, "those members of the body,
which seem to be more feeble, are necessary;" so the words
least understood by grammarians are most necessary in the
correct formation of language.</p>

<p>It is an easy matter to get along with the words called
prepositions, after they are all learned by rote; but when
their meaning and use are inquired into, the best grammarians
have little to say of them.</p>

<p>A list of prepositions, alphabetically arranged, is found in
nearly every grammar, which scholars are required to commit
to memory, without knowing any thing of their meaning
or use, only that they are prepositions when an objective
word comes after them, <i>because the books say so</i>; but
occasionally the same words occur as adverbs and adjectives.
There is, however, no trouble in "parsing" them,
unless the list is forgotten. In that case, you will see the
pupil, instead of inquiring after the meaning and duty of the
word, go to the book and search for it in the lists of
prepo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>sitions
or conjunctions; or to the dictionary, to see if there
is a "<i>prep.</i>" appended to it. What will children ever learn
of language in this way? Of what avail is all such grammar
teaching? As soon as they leave school it is all forgotten;
and you will hear them say, at the very time they
should be reaping the harvest of former toil, that they once
understood grammar, but it is all gone from them. Poor
souls! their memory is very treacherous, else they have
never learned language as they ought. There is a fault
somewhere. To us it is not difficult to determine where
it is.</p>

<p>That certain words are prepositions, there can be no doubt,
because the books say they are; but <i>why</i> they are so, is
quite another matter. All we desire is to have their meaning
understood. Little difficulty will then be found in determining
their use.</p>

<p>I have said they are derived from verbs, many of which
are obsolete. Some are still in use, both as verbs and
nouns. Take for example the word <span class="smcap">with</span>. This word
signifies <i>joined</i> or <i>united</i>. It is used to show that two things
are some how joined together so that they are spoke of in
connexion. It frequently occurs in common conversation,
as a verb and noun, but not as frequently in the books as
formerly. The farmer says to his <i>hired</i> man, "Go and get
a <i>withe</i> and come and <i>withe</i> up the fence;" that is, get some
pliant twigs of tough wood, twist them together, and <i>withe</i>
or bind them round these posts, so that one may stand firm
<i>with</i>, or <i>withed</i> to, the other. A book <i>with</i> a cover, is one
that has a cover <i>joined</i>, bound, or attached to it. "A
father <i>with</i> a son, a man <i>with</i> an estate, a nation <i>with</i> a constitution."
In all such cases <i>with</i> expresses the relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
between the two things mentioned, produced by a <i>union</i> or
connexion with each
other.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> is used in the same way. It is still retained as a
noun and is suspended on the signs of many public houses.
"The traveller's <i>inn</i>," is a house where travellers <i>in</i> themselves,
or go <i>in</i>, for entertainment. It occurs frequently in
Shakspeare and in more modern writers, as a verb, and is
still used in common conversation as an imperative. "Go,
<i>in</i> the crops of grain." "<i>In</i> with you." "<i>In</i> with it."
In describes one thing by its relation to another, which is the
business of adjectives. It admits of the regular degrees of
comparison; as, <i>in</i>, <i>inner</i>, <i>innermost</i> or <i>inmost</i>. It also has
its compounds. <i>In</i>step, the <i>inner</i> part of the foot, <i>in</i>let, <i>in</i>vestment,
<i>in</i>heritance. In this capacity it is extensively
used under its different shades of meaning which I cannot
stop to notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> signifies <i>divided</i>, <i>separated</i>, or <i>parted</i>. "The ship is
<i>off</i> the coast." "I am bound <i>off</i>, and you are bound <i>out</i>."
"A part <i>of</i> a pencil," is that part which is <i>separated</i> from
the rest, implying that the act of <i>separating</i>, or <i>offing</i>, has
taken place. "A branch <i>of</i> the tree." There is the tree;
this branch is from it. "Our communication was broken <i>off</i>
several years ago." "Sailors record their <i>off</i>ings, and parents
love their <i>off</i>spring," or those children which sprung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
from them.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
"We also <i>are his offspring</i>;" that is, sprung
from God.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
In all these, and every other case, you will perceive
the meaning of the word, and its office will soon appear
essential in the expression of thought. Had all the
world been a compact whole, nothing ever separated from
it, we could never speak of a part <i>of</i> it, for we could never
have such an idea. But we look at things, as separated,
divided, parted; and speak of one thing as separated from
the others. Hence, when we speak of the part of the earth
we inhabit, we, in imagination, separate it from some other
<i>part</i>, or the general whole. We can not use this word in
reference to a thing which is indivisible, because we can conceive
no idea of a part <i>of</i> an indivisible thing. We do not
say, a portion <i>of</i> our mind taken as a whole, but as capable
of division. A share <i>of</i> our regards, supposes that the remainder
is reserved for something else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Out</span>, out<i>er</i> or utter, outer<i>most</i> or utmost, admits of the
same remark as <i>in</i>.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>In this manner, we might explain a long list of words,
called adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions. But I forbear,
for the present, the further consideration of this subject,
and leave it for another lecture.</p>

admit of comparison.</p></div>


<p>We resume the consideration of Adjectives. The importance
of this class of words in the expression of our thoughts,
is my excuse for bestowing upon it so much labor. Had
words always been used according to their primitive meaning,
there would be little danger of being misunderstood.
But the fact long known, "<i>Verba mutanter</i>"&mdash;words change&mdash;has
been the prolific source of much of the diversity of
opinion, asperity of feeling, and apparent misconstruction of
other's sentiments, which has disturbed society, and disgraced
mankind. I have, in a former lecture, alluded to
this point, and call it up in this place to prepare your minds
to understand what is to be said on the secondary use of
words in the character of adjectives.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of adjectives in general, as derived
from nouns and verbs, and was somewhat particular upon
the class sometimes called <i>prepositions</i>, which describe one
thing by its relation to another, produced by some action
which has placed them in such relation. We will now pass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to examine a little more minutely into the character and use
of certain adjectives, and the manner of their derivation.</p>

<p>We commence with those derived from nouns, both common
and proper, which are somewhat peculiar in their character.
I wish you distinctly to bear in mind the use of adjectives.
They are words <i>added to nouns to define or describe
them</i>.</p>

<p>Many words which name things, are used as adjectives,
with out change; as, <i>ox</i> beef, <i>beef</i> cattle, <i>paper</i> books, <i>straw</i>
hats, <i>bonnet</i> paper. Others admit of change, or addition;
as, nation<i>al</i> character, a merci<i>ful</i> (mercy-<i>ful</i>) man, a gloom<i>y</i>
prospect, a fam<i>ous</i> horse, a gold<i>en</i> ball. The syllables
which are added, are parts of words, which are at first compounded
with them, till, by frequency of use, they are incorporated
into the same word. "A merci<i>ful</i> man" is one
who is full of mercy. A gold<i>en</i> ball is one made of gold.
This word is sometimes used without change; as, a <i>gold</i>
ring.</p>

<p>A numerous portion of these words take the syllable <i>ly</i>,
contracted from <i>like</i>, which is still retained in many words;
as, Judas-<i>like</i>, lady-<i>like</i>, gentleman-<i>like</i>. These two last
words, are of late, occasionally used as other words, lady<i>ly</i>,
gentleman<i>ly</i>; but the last more frequently than the former.
She behaved very ladi<i>ly</i>, or lady<i>like</i>; and his appearance
was quite gentleman<i>ly</i>. But to say ladi<i>ly</i> appearance, does
not yet sound quite soft enough; but it is incorrect only because
it is uncommon. God<i>ly</i> and god<i>like</i> are both in use,
and equally correct, with a nice shade of difference in
meaning.</p>

<p>All grammarians have found a difficulty in the word <i>like</i>,
which they were unable to unravel. They could never account
for its use in expressing a relation between two
objec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>tives.
They forgot that to be like, one thing must be <i>likened</i>
to another, and that it was the very meaning of this word to
express such like<i>ness</i>. John looks <i>like</i> his brother. The
looks, the countenance, or appearance of John, are <i>likened</i>
to his brother's looks or appearance. "This machine is
more like the pattern than any I have seen." Here the
adjective <i>like</i> takes the comparative degree, as it is called,
to show a nearer resemblance than has been before observed
between the things compared. "He has a statesman-<i>like</i>
appearance." I <i>like</i> this apple, because it agrees with
my taste; it has qualities <i>like</i> my notion of what is palateable."
In every situation the word is used to express likeness
between two things. It describes one thing by its likeness
to another.</p>

<p>Many adjectives are formed from proper nouns by adding
an apostrophe and the letter <i>s</i>, except when the word
ends in <i>s</i>, in which case the final <i>s</i> is usually omitted for
the sake of euphony. This, however, was not generally
adopted by old writers. It is not observed in the earliest
translations of the Bible into the english language. It is
now in common practice. Thus, Montgomery's monument
in front of St. Paul's church; Washington's funeral; Shay's
rebelion; England's bitterest foes; Hamlet's father's ghost;
Peter's wife's mother; Todd's, Walker's, Johnson's dictionary;
Winchell's Watts' hymns; Pond's Murray's grammar.
No body would suppose that the "relation of property or
possession" was expressed in these cases, as our grammar
books tell us, but that the terms employed are used to <i>define</i>
certain objects, about which we are speaking. They
possess the true character and use of adjectives, and as
such let them be regarded. It must be as false as frivolous
to say that Montgomery, who nobly fell at the siege of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Quebec, <i>owns</i> the monument erected over his remains, which
were conveyed to New-York many years after his death;
or that St. Paul <i>owns</i> or <i>possesses</i> the church beneath which
they were deposited; that Hamlet owned his father, and
his father his ghost; that Todd owns Walker, and Walker
owns Johnson, and Johnson his dictionary which may have
had a hundred owners, and never been the property of its
author, but printed fifty years after his death. These words,
I repeat, are merely <i>definitive</i> terms, and like others serve
to point out or specify particular objects which may thus be
better known.</p>

<p>Words, however, in common use form adjectives the
same as other words; as, Russia iron, China ships, India
silks, Vermont cheese, Orange county butter, New-York
flour, Carolina potatoes. Morocco leather was first manufactured
in a city of Africa called by that name, but it is
now made in almost every town in our country. The same
may be said of Leghorn hats, Russia binding, French shoes,
and China ware. Although made in our own country we
still retain the words, morocco, leghorn, russia, french, and
china, to define the fashion, kind, or quality of articles to
which we allude. Much china ware is made in Liverpool,
which, to distinguish it from the real, is called liverpool
china. Many french shoes are made in Lynn, and many
Roxbury russets, Newton pippins, and Rhode-Island greenings,
grow in Vermont.</p>

<p>It may not be improper here to notice the adjectives derived
from pronouns, which retain so much of their character
as relates to the persons who employ them. These are
<i>my</i>, <i>thy</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>,
<i>your</i>, <i>their</i>, <i>whose</i>. This is <i>my</i>
book, that is <i>your</i> pen, this is <i>his</i> knife, and that is <i>her</i> letter.
Some of these, like other words, vary their ending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
when standing alone; as, two apples are your<i>s</i>, three her<i>s</i>,
six their<i>s</i>, five our<i>s</i>, and the rest mine. <i>His</i> does not alter
in popular use. Hence the reason why you hear it so often,
in common conversation, when standing without the noun
expressed, pronounced as if written <i>hisen</i>. The word <i>other</i>,
and some others, come under the same remark. When the
nouns specified are expressed, they take the regular termination;
as, give me these Baldwin apples, and a few others&mdash;a
few other apples.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>There is a class of small words which from the frequency
of their use have, like pronouns, lost their primitive
character, and are now preserved only as adjectives. Let
us examine a few of them by endeavoring to ferret out their
true meaning and application in the expression of ideas.
We will begin with the old articles, <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>, by testing
the truth and propriety of the duty commonly assigned
to them in our grammars.</p>

<p>The standard grammar asserts that "an article is a word
prefixed to substantives, to point them out, and to show how
far their signification extends; as, "a garden, an eagle, the
woman." Skepticism in grammar is no crime, so we will
not hesitate to call in question the correctness of this "best
of all grammars beyond all comparison." Let us consider
the very examples given. They were doubtless the best
that could be found. Does <i>a</i> "point out" the garden, or
"show how far its signification extends?" It does neither
of these things. It may name "<i>any</i>" garden, and it certainly
does not define whether it is a <i>great</i> or a <i>small</i> one.
It simply determines that <i>one</i> garden is the subject of remark.
All else is to be determined by the word <i>garden</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
We <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'are are'">are</ins>
told there are two articles, the one <i>in</i>definite,
the other definite&mdash;<i>a</i> is the former, and <i>the</i> the latter. I
shall leave it with you to reconcile the apparent contradiction
of an <i>indefinite</i> article which "is used in a <i>vague sense,
to point out the signification</i> of another word." But I challenge
teachers to make their pupils comprehend such a jargon,
if they can do it themselves. But it is as good sense
as we find in many of the popular grammars of the day.</p>

<p>Again, Murray says "<i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i> before a vowel or
silent <i>h</i>;" and so say all his <i>simplifying</i> satellites after him.
Is such the fact? Is he right? He is, I most unqualifiedly
admit, with this little correction, the addition of a single
word&mdash;he is right <i>wrong</i>! Instead of <i>a</i> becoming <i>an</i>, the
reverse is the fact. The word is derived directly from the
same word which still stands as our first numeral. It was a
short time since written <i>ane</i>, as any one may see by consulting
all old books. By and by it dropped the <i>e</i>, and afterwards,
for the sake of euphony, in certain cases, the <i>n</i>,
so that now it stands a single letter. You all have lived
long enough to have noticed the changes in the word.
Formerly we said <i>an</i> union, <i>an</i> holiday, <i>an</i> universalist, <i>an</i>
unitarian, &amp;c., expressions which are now rarely heard.
We now say <i>a</i> union, &amp;c. This single instance proves
that arbitrary rules of grammar have little to do in the regulation
of language. Its barriers are of sand, soon removed.
It will not be said that this is an unimportant mistake,
for, if an error, it is pernicious, and if a grammarian
knows enough to say that <i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i>, he ought to know
that he tells a falsehood, and that <i>an</i> becomes <i>a</i> under certain
circumstances. Mr. Murray gives the following example
to illustrate the use of <i>a</i>. "Give me <i>a</i> book; that
is, <i>any</i> book." How can the learner understand such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rule? How will it apply? Let us try it. "A man has <i>a</i>
wife;" that is, <i>any</i> man has <i>any</i> wife. I have a hat; that
is, <i>any</i> hat. A farmer has a farm&mdash;<i>any</i> farmer has <i>any</i>
farm. A merchant in Boston has a beautiful piece of broadcloth&mdash;<i>any</i>
merchant in Boston has any beautiful piece of
broadcloth. A certain king of Europe decreed a protestant
to be burned&mdash;<i>any</i> king of Europe decreed <i>any</i> protestant
to be burned. How ridiculous are the rules we have learned
and taught to others, to enable them to "speak and write
with propriety." No wonder we never understood grammar,
if so at variance with truth and every day's experience.
The rules of grammar as usually taught can never
be observed in practice. Hence it is called a <i>dry study</i>.
In every thing else we learn something that we can understand,
which will answer some good purpose in the affairs
of life. But this branch of science is among the things
which have been tediously learned to no purpose. No good
account can be given of its advantages.</p>

<p><i>The</i>, we are told, "is called the definite article, because
it ascertains what <i>particular</i> thing or things are meant." A
most unfortunate definition, and quite as erroneous as the
former. Let us try it. <i>The</i> stars shine, <i>the</i> lion roars, <i>the</i>
camel is a beast of burden, <i>the</i> deer is good for food, <i>the</i>
wind blows, <i>the</i> clouds appear, <i>the</i> Indians are abused.
What is there in these examples, which "ascertain what
<i>particular</i> thing or things are meant?" They are expressions
as <i>in</i>definite as we can imagine.</p>

<p>On the other hand, should I say <i>a</i> star shines, <i>a</i> lion roars,
<i>an</i> Indian is abused, <i>a</i> wind blows, <i>a</i> cloud appears, you
would understand me to allude very <i>definitely</i> to <i>one</i> "particular"
object, as separate and distinguished from others of
its kind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
But what is the wonderful peculiarity in the meaning and
use of these two little words that makes them so unlike
every thing else, as to demand a separate "part of speech?"
You may be surprised when I tell you that there are other
words in our language derived from the same source and
possessed of the same meaning; but such is the fact, as
will soon appear. Let us ask for the etymology of these
important words. <i>A</i> signifies <i>one</i>, never more, never less.
In this respect it is always <i>definite</i>. It is sometimes applied
to a single thing, sometimes to a whole class of things,
to a [one] man, or to a [one] hundred men. It may be
traced thro other languages, ancient and modern, with little
modification in spelling; Greek <i>eis</i>, ein; Latin <i>unus</i>;
Armoric <i>unan</i>; Spanish and Italian <i>uno</i>; Portuguese <i>hum</i>;
French <i>un</i>; German <i>ein</i>; Danish <i>een</i>, <i>en</i>; Dutch <i>een</i>;
Swedish <i>en</i>; Saxon, <i>an</i>, <i>aen</i>, <i>one</i>&mdash;from which ours is
directly derived&mdash;old English <i>ane</i>; and more modernly
<i>one</i>, <i>an</i>, <i>a</i>. In all languages it defines a thing to be <i>one</i>, a
united or congregated whole, and the word <i>one</i> may always
be substituted without affecting the sense. From it is derived
our word <i>once</i>, which signifies <i>oned</i>, <i>united</i>, <i>joined</i>,
as we shall see when we come to speak of "contractions."
In some languages <i>a</i> is styled an article, in others it is not.
The Latin, for instance, has no article, and the Greek has
no <i>indefinite</i>. But all languages have words which are
like ours, pure adjectives, employed to specify certain
things. The argument drawn from the fact that some other
languages have <i>articles</i>, and therefore ours should, is fallacious.
The Latin, which was surpassed for beauty of style
or power in deliverance by few, if any others, never suffered
from the lack of articles. Nor is there any reason why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
we should honor two small adjectives with that high rank
to the exclusion of others quite as worthy.</p>

<p><i>The</i> is always used as a definitive word, tho it is the least
definite of the defining adjectives. In fact when we desire
to "<i>ascertain particularly</i> what thing is meant," we select
some more definite word. "Give me <i>the</i> books." Which?
"Those with red covers, that in calf, and this in Russia
binding." <i>The</i> nations are at peace. What nations?
<i>Those</i> which were at war. You perceive how we employ
words which are more definite, that is, better understood, to
"<i>point out</i>" the object of conversation, especially when there
is any doubt in the case. What occasion, then, is there to
give these [the?] words a separate "part of speech,"
since in character they do not differ from others in the language?</p>

<p>We will notice another frivolous distinction made by Mr.
Murray, merely to show how learned men may be mistaken,
and the folly of trusting to special rules in the general
application of words. He says, "Thou art <i>a</i> man,"
is a very general and <i>harmless</i> expression; but, thou art
<i>the</i> man, (as Nathan said to David,) is an assertion capable
of striking terror and remorse into the heart." The distinction
in meaning here, on which he insists, attaches to
the articles <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>. It is a sufficient refutation of this
definition to make a counter statement. Suppose we say,
"Murray is <i>the</i> best grammarian in the world; or, he is <i>a</i>
fool, <i>a</i> knave, and <i>a</i> liar." Which, think you, would be
considered the most <i>harmless</i> expression? Suppose it had
been said to Aaron Burr, thou art <i>a</i> traitor, or to General
William Hull, thou art <i>a</i> coward, would they regard the
phrase as "<i>harmless!</i>" On the other hand, suppose a
beautiful, accomplished, and talented young lady, should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
observe to one of her suitors, "I have received offers of
marriage from several gentlemen besides yourself, but thou
art <span class="smcap">the</span> man of my choice;" would it, think you, <i>strike</i>
terror and remorse into his heart? I should pity the young
student of Murray whose feelings had become so stoical
from the false teaching of his author as to be filled with
"terror and remorse" under such favorable circumstances,
while fair prospects of future happiness were thus rapidly
brightening before him. I speak as to the wise, judge ye
what I say.</p>

<p>The adjective <i>that</i> has obtained a very extensive application
in language. However, it may seem to vary in its
different positions, it still retains its primitive meaning. It
is comprised of <i>the</i> and <i>it</i>, thait, theat, thaet (Saxon,) thata
(Gothic,) dat (Dutch.) It is the most decided definitive in
our language. It is by use applied to things in the singular,
or to a multitude of things regarded as a whole. By
use, it applies to a collection of ideas expressed in a sentence;
as, it was resolved, <i>that</i>. What? Then follows
<i>that fact</i> which was resolved. "Provided <i>that</i>, in case he
does" so and so. "It was agreed <i>that</i>," <i>that fact</i> was
agreed to which is about to be made known. I wish you
to understand, all thro these lectures, <i>that</i> I shall honestly
endeavor to expose error and establish truth. Wish you
to understand <i>what</i>? <i>that fact</i>, afterwards stated, "I shall
endeavor," &amp;c. You can not mistake my meaning: <i>that</i>
would be impossible. What would be impossible? Why,
to mistake my meaning.</p>

<p>You can not fail to observe the true character of this
word called by our grammarians "adjective pronoun,"
"relative pronoun," and "conjunction." They did not think
to look for its meaning. Had that (duty) been done, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
would have stood forth in its true character, an important
defining word.</p>

<p>The only difficulty in the explanation of this word, originates
in the fact, that it was formerly applied to the plural
as well as singular number. It is now applied to the singular
only when referring directly to an object; as, <i>that
man</i>. And it never should be used otherwise. But we often
see phrases like this; "These are the men <i>that</i> rebeled."
It should be, "these are the men <i>who</i> rebeled." This difficulty
can not be overcome in existing grammars on any
other ground. In modern writings, such instances are rare.
<i>This</i> and <i>that</i> are applied to the singular; <i>these</i> and <i>those</i>
to the plural.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is a compound of two original words, and often retains
the meaning of both, when employed as a compound
relative, "having in itself both the antecedent and the
relative," as our authors tell us. But when it is dissected,
it will readily enough be understood to be an adjective, defining
things under particular relations.</p>

<p>But I shall weary your patience, I fear, if I stay longer
in this place to examine the etymology of small words. I
intended to have shown the meaning and use of many words
included in the list of conjunctions, which are truly adjectives,
such as <i>both</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>neither</i>, <i>and</i>, etc.; but I let them
pass for the present, to be resumed under the head of contractions.</p>

<p>From the view we have given of this class of words, we
are saved the tediousness of studying the grammatical distinctions
made in the books, where no real distinctions exist.
In character these words are like adjectives; their meaning,
like the meaning of all other words, is peculiar to
them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>selves.
Let that be known, and there will be little difficulty
in classing them. We need not confuse the learner with
"adjective pronouns, possessive adjective pronouns, distributive
adjective pronouns, demonstrative adjective pronouns,
<i>indefinite</i> adjective pronouns," nor any other adjective pronouns,
which can never be understood nor explained. Children
will be slow to apprehend the propriety of a union of
<i>adjectives</i> and <i>pronouns</i>, when told that the former is always
used <i>with</i> a noun, and never <i>for</i> one; and the latter always
<i>for</i> a noun, but never <i>with</i> one; and yet, that there is
such a strange combination as a "<i>distributive or indefinite
adjective pronoun</i>,"&mdash;"confusion worse confounded."</p>

<p>In the french language, the gender of adjectives is varied
so as to agree with the nouns to which they belong. "Possessive
pronouns," as they are called, come under the same
rule, which proves them to be in character, and formation,
adjectives; else the person using them must change gender.
The father says, <i>ma</i> (feminine) <i>fille</i>, my daughter;
and the mother, <i>mon</i> (masculine) <i>fils</i>, my son; the same as
they would say, <i>bon pere</i>, good father; <i>bonne mere</i>, good
mother; or, in Latin, <i>bonus pater</i>, or <i>bona mater</i>; or, in
Spanish, <i>bueno padre</i>, <i>buena madre</i>. In the two last languages,
as well as all others, where the adjectives vary the
termination so as to agree with the noun, the same fact may
be observed in reference to their "pronouns." If it is a
fact that these words are <i>pronouns</i>, that is, stand for other
<i>nouns</i>, then the father is <i>feminine</i>, and the mother
is <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mascu.line'"><i>masculine</i></ins>;
and whoever uses them in reference to the opposite
sex must change gender to do so.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>Describing adjectives admit of variation to express different
degrees of comparison. The regular degrees have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
reckoned three; positive, comparative, and superlative.
These are usually marked by changing the termination.
The <i>positive</i> is determined by a comparison with other
things; as, a great house, a small book, compared with others
of their kind. This is truly a comparative degree. The
<i>comparative</i> adds <i>er</i>; as, a great<i>er</i> house, a small<i>er</i> book.
The <i>superlative</i>, <i>est</i>; as, the great<i>est</i> house, the small<i>est</i>
book.</p>

<p>Several adjectives express a comparison less than the
positive, others increase or diminish the regular degrees;
as, whit<i>ish</i> white, <i>very</i> white, <i>pure</i> white; whit<i>er</i>, <i>considerable</i>
whiter, <i>much</i> whiter; whit<i>est</i>, the <i>very</i> whitest, <i>much</i>
the whitest <i>beyond all comparison</i>, so that there can be none
<i>whiter</i>, nor <i>so white</i>.</p>

<p>We make an aukward use of the words <i>great</i> and <i>good</i>,
in the comparison of things; as, a <i>good deal</i>, or <i>great deal</i>
whiter; a <i>good</i> many men, or a <i>great</i> many men. As we
never hear of a <i>small</i> deal, or a <i>bad</i> deal whiter, nor of a
<i>bad many</i>, nor <i>little many</i>, it would be well to avoid such
phrases.</p>

<p>The words which are added to other adjectives, to increase
or diminish the comparison,
or <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'asist'">assist</ins> in their definition,
may properly be called <i>secondary adjectives</i>, for such
is their character. They do not refer to the thing to be <i>defined</i>
or <i>described</i>, but to the adjective which is affected, in
some way, by them. They are easily distinguished from
the rest by noticing this fact. Take for example: "A <i>very
dark red</i> raw silk lady's dress
handkerchief<ins class="correction" title="Trancriber's Note: original lacks &quot;">."</ins> The resolution
of this sentence would stand thus:</p>

<p>We might also observe that <i>hand</i> is an adjective, compounded
by use with <i>kerchief</i>. It is derived from the french
word <i>couvrir</i>, to cover, and <i>chef</i>, the head. It means a
head dress, a cloth to cover, a neck cloth, a napkin. By
habit we apply it to a single article, and speak of <i>neck</i>
handkerchief.</p>

<p>The nice shade of meaning, and the appropriate use of
adjectives, is more distinctly marked in distinguishing colors
than in any thing else, for the simple reason, that there is
nothing in nature so closely observed. For instance, take
the word <i>green</i>, derived from <i>grain</i>, because it is grain color,
or the color of the fair carpet of nature in spring and summer.
But this hue changes from the <i>deep grass green</i>, to
the light olive, and words are chosen to express the thousand
varying tints produced by as many different objects. In the
adaptation of language to the expression of ideas, we do not
separate these shades of color from the things in which such
colors are supposed to reside. Hence we talk of <i>grass</i>, <i>pea</i>,
<i>olive</i>, <i>leek</i>, <i>verdigris</i>, <i>emerald</i>, <i>sea</i>, and <i>bottle</i> green; also, of
<i>light</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>medium</i>; <i>very</i> light, or dark grass, pea, olive, or
<i>invisible</i> green.</p>

<p><i>Red</i>, as a word, means <i>rayed</i>. It describes the appearance
or substance produced when <i>rayed</i>, reddened, or radiated
by the morning beams of the sun, or any other <i>radiating</i>
cause.</p>

<p><i>Wh</i> is used for <i>qu</i>, in white, which means <i>quite</i>, <i>quited</i>,
<i>quitted</i>, <i>cleared</i>, <i>cleansed</i> of all <i>color</i>, <i>spot</i>, or <i>stain</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
<i>Blue</i> is another spelling for <i>blew</i>. Applied to color, it
describes something in appearance to the sky, when the
clouds and mists are <i>blown</i> away, and the clear <i>blue ether</i>
appears.</p>

<p>You will be pleased with the following extract from an
eloquent writer of the last
century,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
who, tho somewhat extravagant
in some of his speculations, was, nevertheless, a
close observer of nature, which he studied as it is, without
the aid of human theories. The beauty of the style, and
the correctness of the sentiment, will be a sufficient apology
for its length.</p>

<p>"We shall employ a method, not quite so learned, to
convey an idea of the generation of colors, and the decomposition
of the solar ray. Instead of examining them in a
prism of glass, we shall consider them in the heavens, and
there we shall behold the five primordial colours <i>unfold
themselves</i> in the order which we have indicated.</p>

<p>"In a fine summer's night, when the sky is loaded only
with some light vapours, sufficient to stop and to refract the
rays of the sun, walk out into an open plain, where the first
fires of Aurora may be perceptible. You will first observe
the horizon <i>whiten</i> at the spot where she is to make
her appearance; and this radiance, from its colour, has
procured for it, in the French language, the name of <i>aube</i>,
(the dawn,) from the Latin word <i>alba</i>, white. This whiteness
insensibly ascends in the heavens, <i>assuming</i> a tint of
yellow some degrees above the horizon; the yellow as it
rises passes into orange; and this shade of orange rises upward
into the lively vermilion, which extends as far as the
zenith. From that point you will perceive in the heavens
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
behind you the violet succeeding the vermilion, then the
azure, after it the deep blue or indigo colour, and, last of all,
the black, quite to the westward.</p>

<p>"Though this display of colours presents a multitude of
intermediate shades, which rapidly succeed each other, yet
at the moment the sun is going to exhibit his disk, the
dazzling white is visible in the horizon, the pure yellow at
an elevation of forty-five degrees; the fire color in the zenith;
the pure blue forty-five degrees under it, toward the
west; and in the very west the dark veil of night still lingering
on the horizon. I think I have remarked this progression
between the tropics, where there is scarcely any
horizontal refraction to make the light prematurely encroach
on the darkness, as in our climates.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the trade-winds, from the north-east or south-east,
blow there, card the clouds through each other, then
sweep them to the west, crossing and recrossing them over
one another, like the osiers interwoven in a transparent basket.
They throw over the sides of this chequered work
the clouds which are not employed in the contexture, roll
them up into enormous masses, as white as snow, draw
them out along their extremities in the form of a crupper,
and pile them upon each other, moulding them into the
shape of mountains, caverns, and rocks; afterwards, as
evening approaches, they grow somewhat calm, as if afraid
of deranging their own workmanship. When the sun sets
behind this magnificent netting, a multitude of luminous
rays are transmitted through the interstices, which produce
such an effect, that the two sides of the lozenge illuminated
by them have the appearance of being girt with gold, and
the other two in the shade seem tinged with <i>ruddy</i> orange.
Four or five divergent streams of light, emanated from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
setting sun up to the zenith, <i>clothe</i> with fringes of gold the
undeterminate summits of this celestial barrier, and strike
with the reflexes of their fires the pyramids of the collateral
aerial mountains, which then appear to consist of <i>silver</i> and
<i>vermilion</i>. At this moment of the evening are perceptible,
amidst their redoubled ridges, a multitude of valleys extending
into infinity, and distinguishing themselves at their opening
by some shade of flesh or of rose colour.</p>

<p>"These celestial valleys present in their different contours
inimitable tints of white, melting away into white, or shades
lengthening themselves out without mixing over other shades.
You see, here and there, issuing from the cavernous sides
of those mountains, tides of <i>light</i> precipitating themselves, in
ingots of gold and silver, over rocks of coral. Here it is a
gloomy rock, pierced through and through, disclosing, beyond
the aperture, the pure azure of the firmament; there
it is an extensive strand, covered with sands of gold, stretching
over the rich ground of heaven; <i>poppy-coloured</i>, <i>scarlet</i>,
and <i>green</i> as the emerald.</p>

<p>"The reverberation of those western colours diffuses itself
over the sea, whose azure billows it <i>glazes</i> with saffron
and purple. The mariners, leaning over the gunwale of
the ship, admire in silence those aerial landscapes. Sometimes
this sublime spectacle presents itself to them at the
hour of prayer, and seems to invite them to lift up their
hearts with their voices to the heavens. It changes every
instant into forms as variable as the shades, presenting celestial
colors and forms which no pencil can pretend to imitate,
and no language can describe.</p>

<p>"Travellers who have, at various seasons, ascended to
the summits of the highest mountains on the globe, never
could perceive, in the clouds below them, any thing but a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
gray and lead-colored surface, similar to that of a lake.
The sun, notwithstanding, illuminated them with his whole
light; and his rays might there combine all the laws of refraction
to which our systems of physics have subjected
them. Hence not a single shade of color is employed in
vain, through the universe; those celestial decorations being
made for the level of the earth, their magnificent point
of view taken from the habitation of man.</p>

<p>"These admirable concerts of lights and forms, manifest
only in the lower region of the clouds the least illuminated
by the sun, are produced by laws with which I am totally
unacquainted. But the whole are reducible to five colors:
yellow, a generation from white; red, a deeper shade of
yellow; blue, a strong tint of red; and black, the extreme
tint of blue. This progression cannot be doubted, on observing
in the morning the expansion of the light in the
heavens. You there see those five colors, with their intermediate
shades, generating each other nearly in this order:
white, sulphur yellow, lemon yellow, yolk of egg yellow,
orange, aurora color, poppy red, full red, carmine red, purple,
violet, azure, indigo, and black. Each color seems to
be only a strong tint of that which precedes it, and a faint
tint of that which follows; thus the whole together appear
to be only modulations of a progression, of which white is
the first term, and black the last.</p>

<p>"Indeed trade cannot be carried on to any advantage,
with the Negroes, Tartars, Americans, and East-Indians,
but through the medium of red cloths. The testimonies of
travellers are unanimous respecting the preference universally
given to this color. I have indicated the universality
of this taste, merely to demonstrate the falsehood of the philosophic
axiom, that tastes are arbitrary, or that there are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in Nature no laws for beauty, and that our tastes are the
effects of prejudice. The direct contrary of this is the truth;
prejudice corrupts our natural tastes, otherwise the same
over the whole earth.</p>

<p>"With red Nature heightens the brilliant parts of the
most beautiful flowers. She has given a complete clothing
of it to the rose, the queen of the garden: and bestowed
this tint on the blood, the principle of life in animals: she
invests most of the feathered race, in India, with a plumage
of this color, especially in the season of love; and there are
few birds without some shades, at least, of this rich hue.
Some preserve entirely the gray or brown ground of their
plumage, but glazed over with red, as if they had been rolled
in carmine; others are besprinkled with red, as if you
had blown a scarlet powder over them.</p>

<p>"The red (or <i>rayed</i>) color, in the midst of the five primordial
colors, is the harmonic expression of them by way of
excellence; and the result of the union of two contraries,
light and darkness. There are, besides, agreeable tints,
compounded of the oppositions of extremes. For example,
of the second and fourth color, that is, of yellow and blue,
is formed green, which constitutes a very beautiful harmony,
and ought, perhaps, to possess the second rank in beauty,
among colors, as it possesses the second in their generation.
Nay, green appears to many, if not the most beautiful tint,
at least the most lovely, because it is less dazzling than red,
and more congenial to the eye."</p>

<p>Many words come under the example previously given
to illustrate the secondary character of adjectives, which
should be carefully noticed by the learner, to distinguish
whether they define or describe things, or are added to increase
the distinction made by the adjectives themselves, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
both defining and describing adjectives admit of this addition;
as, <i>old</i> English coin, New England rebelion; a mounted
whip, and a <i>gold</i> mounted sword&mdash;not a gold sword; a
<i>very fine</i> Latin scholar.</p>

<p>Secondary adjectives, also, admit of comparison in various
ways; as, <i>dearly</i> beloved, a <i>more</i> beloved, the <i>best</i> beloved,
the <i>very</i> best beloved brother.</p>

<p>Words formerly called "prepositions," admit of comparison,
as I have before observed. "Benhadad fled into an
<i>inner</i> chamber." The in<i>ner</i> temple. The in<i>most</i> recesses
of the heart. The <i>out</i> fit of a squadron. The out<i>er</i> coating
of a vessel, or house. The ut<i>most</i> reach of grammar.
The <i>up</i> and <i>down</i> hill side of a field. The up<i>per</i> end of the
lot. The upper<i>most</i> seats. A part <i>of</i> the book. Take it
<i>farther off</i>. The <i>off</i> cast. India <i>beyond</i> the Ganges. Far
beyond the boundaries of the nation. I shall go <i>to</i> the city.
I am <i>near to</i> the town. <i>Near</i> does not <i>qualify the verb</i>, for
it has nothing to do with it. I can exist in one place as well
as another. It is <i>below</i> the surface; <i>very far</i> below it. It
is above the earth&mdash;"high above all height."</p>

<p>Such expressions frequently occur in the expression of
ideas, and are correctly understood; as difficult as it may
have been to describe them with the theories learned in the
books&mdash;sometimes calling them one thing, sometimes another&mdash;when
their character and meaning was unchanged,
or, according to old systems, had "no meaning at all of their
own!"</p>

<p>But I fear I have gone <i>far</i> beyond your patience, and,
perhaps, entered <i>deeper</i> into this subject than was necessary,
to enable you to discover my meaning. I desired to make
the subject <i>as</i> distinct <i>as</i> possible, that all might see the important
improvement suggested. I am apprehensive even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
now, that some will be compelled to <i>think</i> many <i>profound
thoughts</i> before they will see the end of the obscurity under
which they have long been shrouded, in reference to the
false rules which they have been taught. But we have one
consolation&mdash;those who are not bewildered by the grammars
they have tried in vain to understand, will not be very likely
to make a wrong use of adjectives, especially if they have
ideas to express; for there is no more danger of mistaking
an adjective for a noun, or verb, than there is of mistaking
a <i>horse</i> chestnut for a <i>chestnut</i> horse.</p>

<p>In our next we shall commence the consideration of Verbs,
the most important department in the science of language,
and particularly so in the system we are defending. I hope
you have not been uninterested thus far in the prosecution
of the subject of language, and I am confident you will not
be in what remains to be said upon it. The science, so long
regarded <i>dry</i> and uninteresting, becomes delightful and easy;
new and valuable truths burst upon us at each advancing
step, and we feel to bless God for the ample means afforded
us for obtaining knowledge from, and communicating it to
others, on the most important affairs of time and eternity.</p>

<p>We now come to the consideration of that class of words
which in the formation of language are called <i>Verbs</i>. You
will allow me to bespeak your favorable attention, and to
insist most strenuously on the propriety of a free and thoro
examination into the nature and use of these words. I shall
be under the necessity of performing the thankless task of
exposing the errors of honest, wise, and good men, in order
to remove difficulties which have long existed in works on
language, and clear the way for a more easy and consistent
explanation of this interesting and essential department
of literature. I regret the necessity for such labors; but
no person who wishes the improvement of mankind, or is
willing to aid the growth of the human intellect, in its high
aspirations after truth, knowledge, and goodness, should
shrink from a frank exposition of what he deems to be error,
nor refuse his assistance, feeble tho it may be, in the
establishment of correct principles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
In former lectures we have confined our remarks to
things and a description of their characters and relations,
so that every entity of which we can conceive a thought,
or concerning which we can form an expression, has been
defined and described in the use of nouns and adjectives.
Every thing in creation, of which we think, material or immaterial,
real or imaginary, and to which we give a name,
to represent the idea of it, comes under the class of words
called nouns. The words which specify or distinguish one
thing from another, or describe its properties, character, or
relations, are designated as adjectives. There is only one
other employment left for words, and that is the expression
of the actions, changes, or inherent tendencies of things.
This important department of knowledge is, in grammar,
classed under the head of <span class="smcap">Verbs</span>.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p><i>Verb</i> is derived from the Latin <i>verbum</i>, which signifies a
<i>word</i>. By specific application it is applied to those <i>words</i>
only which express action, correctly understood; the same
as Bible, derived from the Greek "<i>biblos</i>" means literally
<i>the book</i>, but, by way of eminence, is applied to the sacred
scriptures only.</p>

<p>This interesting class of words does not deviate from the
correct principles which we have hitherto observed in these
lectures. It depends on established laws, exerted in the
regulation of matter and thought; and whoever would learn
its sublime use must be a close observer of things, and the
mode of their existence. The important character it sustains
in the production of ideas of the changes and tendencies
of things and in the transmission of thought, will be
found simple, and obvious to all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Things exist; Nouns name them.</p>

<p>Things differ; Adjectives define or describe them.</p>

<p>Things act; Verbs express their actions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>All Verbs denote action.</i></p></div>

<p>By action, we mean not only perceivable motion, but an
inherent tendency to change, or resist action. It matters
not whether we speak of animals possessed of the power of
locomotion; of vegetables, which <i>send</i> forth their branches,
leaves, blossoms, and fruits; or of minerals, which <i>retain</i>
their forms, positions, and properties. The same principles
are concerned, the same laws exist, and should be observed
in all our attempts to understand their operations, or employ
them in the promotion of human good. Every thing acts
according to the ability it possesses; from the small particle
of sand, which <i>occupies</i> its place upon the sea shore, up
thro the various gradation of being, to the tall archangel,
who <i>bows</i> and <i>worships</i> before the throne of the uncreated
Cause of all things and actions which exist thro out his vast
dominions.</p>

<p>As all actions presuppose an <i>actor</i>, so every action must
result on some <i>object</i>. No effect can exist without an efficient
cause to produce it; and no cause can exist without
a corresponding effect resulting from it. These mutual relations,
helps, and dependencies, are manifest in all creation.
Philosophy, religion, the arts, and all science, serve only to
develope these primary laws of nature, which unite and
strengthen, combine and regulate, preserve and guide the
whole. From the Eternal I AM, the uncreated, self-existent,
self-sustaining <span class="smcap">Cause</span> of all things, down to the minutest
particle of dust, evidences may be traced of the existence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and influence of these laws, in themselves irresistible, exceptionless,
and immutable. Every thing has a place and
a duty assigned it; and harmony, peace, and perfection are
the results of a careful and judicious observance of the laws
given for its regulation. Any infringement of these laws
will produce disorder, confusion, and distraction.</p>

<p>Man is made a little lower than the angels, possessed of
a mind capable of reason, improvement, and happiness;
an intellectual soul inhabiting a mortal body, the connecting
link between earth and heaven&mdash;the material and spiritual
world. As a physical being, he is subject, in common with
other things, to the laws which regulate matter: as an intellectual
being, he is governed by the laws which regulate
mind: as possessed of both a body and mind, a code of
moral laws demand his observance in all the social relations
and duties of life. Obedience to these laws is the certain
source of health of body, and peace of mind. An infringement
of them will as certainly be attended with disease and
suffering to the one, and sorrow and anguish to the other.</p>

<p>Lower grades of animals partake of many qualities in
common with man. In some they are deficient; in others
they are superior. Some animals are possessed of all but
reason, and even in that, the highest of them come very little
short of the lowest of the human species. If they have
not reason, they possess an instinct which nearly approaches
it. These qualities dwindle down gradually thro the various
orders and varieties of animated nature, to the lowest
grade of animalcul&aelig;, a multitude of which may inhabit a
single drop of water; or to the zoophytes and lythophytes,
which form the connecting link between the animal and
vegetable kingdom; as the star-fish, the polypus, and
spunges. Then strike off into another kingdom, and
ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>serve
the laws vegetable life. Mark the tall pine which
has grown from a small seed which <i>sent</i> forth its root downwards
and its trunk upwards, drawing nourishment from
earth, air, and water, till it now waves its top to the passing
breeze, a hundred feet above this dirty earth: or the oak
or olive, which have <i>maintained</i> their respective positions a
dozen centuries despite the operations of wind and weather,
and have shed their foliage and their seeds to propagate
their species and extend their kinds to different places.
While a hundred generations have lived and died, and the
country often changed masters, they resist oppression, scorn
misrule, and retain rights and privileges which are slowly
encroached upon by the inroads of time, which will one
day triumph over them, and they fall helpless to the earth,
to submit to the chemical operations which shall dissolve
their very being and cause them to mingle with the common
dust, yielding their strength to give life and power to
other vegetables which shall occupy their
places.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Or mark
the living principle in the "sensitive plant," which withers
at every touch, and suffers long ere it regains its former
vigor.</p>

<p>Descend from thence, down thro the various gradations of
vegetable life, till you pass the narrow border and enter the
mineral world. Here you will see displayed the same sublime
principle, tho in a modified degree. Minerals <i>assume</i>
different shapes, hues and relations; they increase and
di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>minish,
attach and divide under various circumstances, all
the while <i>retaining</i> their identity and properties, and exerting
their abilities according to the means they possess, till
compelled to yield to a superior power, and learn to submit
to the laws which operate in every department of this mutable
world.</p>

<p><i>Every</i> thing <i>acts</i> according to the ability God has bestowed
upon it; and man can do no more. He has authority
over all things on earth, and yet he is made to depend
upon all. His authority extends no farther than a privilege,
under wholesome restrictions, of making the whole
subservient to his real good. When he goes beyond this, he
usurps a power which belongs not to him, and the destruction
of his happiness pays the forfeit of his imprudence.
The injured power rises triumphant over the aggressor, and
the glory of God's government, in the righteous and immediate
execution of his laws, is clearly revealed. So long as
man obeys the laws which regulate health, observes temperance
in all things, uses the things of this world as not
abusing them, he is at rest, he is blessed, he is happy: but
no sooner has he violated heaven's law than he becomes the
slave, and the servant assumes the master. But I am digressing.
I would gladly follow this subject further, but I
shall go beyond my limits, and, it may be, your patience.</p>

<p>I would insist, however, on the facts to which your attention
has been given, for it is impossible, as I have before
contended, to use language correctly without a knowledge
of the things and ideas it is employed to represent.</p>

<p>Grovelling, indeed, must be the mind which will not trace
the sublime exhibitions of Divine power and skill in all the
operations of nature; and false must be that theory which
teaches the young mind to think and speak of neutrality as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
attached to things which do exist. As low and debasing as
the speculations of the schoolmen were, they gave to things
which they conceived to be incapable of action, a principle
which they called "<i>vis inerti&aelig;</i>," or, <i>power to lie still</i>. Shall
our systems of instruction descend below them, throw an
insurmountable barrier in the way of human improvement,
and teach the false principles that actions can exist without
an effect, or that there is a class of words which
"express neither action or passion." Such a theory is at
war with the first principles of philosophy, and denies that
"like causes produce like effects."</p>

<p>The ablest minds have never been able to explain the
foundation of a "neuter verb," or to find a single word, with
a solitary exception, which does not, in certain conditions,
express a positive action, and terminate on a definite object;
and that exception we shall see refers to a verb which expresses
the highest degree of conceivable action. Still they
have insisted on <i>three</i> and some on <i>four</i> kinds of verbs, one
expressing action, another passion or suffering, and the
third neutrality. We propose to offer a brief review of
these distinctions, which have so long perplexed, not only
learners, but teachers themselves, and been the fruitful
source of much dissention among grammarians.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped you will come up to this work with as
great candor as you have heretofore manifested, and as
fully resolved to take nothing for granted, because it has
been said by good or great men, and to reject nothing because
it appears new or singular. Let truth be our object
and reason our guide to direct us to it. We can not fail
of arriving at safe and correct conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. Murray tells us that "verbs are of three kinds, <i>active</i>,
<i>passive</i>, and <i>neuter</i>. In a note he admits of "active
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<i>transitive</i> and intransitive verbs," as a subdivision of his
first kind. Most of his "improvers" have adopted this distinction,
and regard it as of essential importance.</p>

<p>We shall contend, as before expressed, that <i>all</i> verbs are
of <i>one kind</i>, that they <i>express action</i>, for the simple yet
sublime reason, that every thing acts, at all times, and under
every possible condition; according to the true definition
of <i>action</i> as understood and employed by all writers on
grammar, and natural and moral science. Here we are at
issue. Both, contending for principles so opposite, can not
be correct. One or the other, however pure the motives,
must be attached to a system wrong in theory, and of course
pernicious in practice. You are to be the umpires in the
case, and, if you are faithful to your trust, you will not be
bribed or influenced in the least by the opinions of others.
If divested of all former attachments, if free from all prejudice,
there can be no doubt of the safety and correctness of your
conclusions. But I am apprehensive I expect too much, if I
place the <i>new</i> system of grammar on a footing equally favorable
in your minds with those you have been taught to
respect, as the only true expositions of language, from your
childhood up, and which are recommended to you on the
authority of the learned and good of many generations. I
have to combat early prejudices, and systems long considered
as almost sacred. But I have in my favor the common
sense of the world, and a feeling of opposition to existing
systems, which has been produced, not so much by a detection
of their errors, as by a lack of capacity, as the learner
verily thought, to understand their profound mysteries. I
am, therefore, willing to risk the final decision with you, if
<i>you</i> will decide. But I am not willing to have you made
the tools of the opposite party, determined, whether
con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>vinced
or not, to hold to your old <i>neuter</i> verb systems, right
or wrong, merely because others are doing so. All I ask
is <i>your</i> adoption of what is proved to be undeniably true,
and rejection of whatever is found to be false.</p>

<p>Here is where the matter must rest, for it will not be pretended
that it is better to teach falsehood because it is ancient
and popular, than truth because it is novel. Teachers,
in this respect, stand in a most responsible relation to
their pupils. They should always insist with an unyielding
pertinacity, on the importance of truth, and the evils of error.
Every trifling incident, in the course of education,
which will serve to show the contrast, should be particularly
observed. If an error can be detected in their books,
they should be so taught as to be able to correct it; and
they should be so inclined as to be willing to do it. They
should not be skeptics, however, but close observers, original
thinkers, and correct reasoners. It is degrading to the
true dignity and independence of man, to submit blindly to
any proposition. Freedom of thought is the province of all.
Children should be made to breathe the free air of honest
inquiry, and to inhale the sweet spirit of truth and charity.
They should not study their books as the end of learning,
but as a means of knowing. Books should be regarded as
lamps, which are set by the way side, not as the objects to
be looked at, but the aids by which we may find the object
of our search. Knowledge and usefulness constitute the
leading motives in all study, and no occasion should be lost,
no means neglected, which will lead the young mind to their
possession.</p>

<p>Your attention is now invited to some critical remarks on
the distinctions usually observed in the use of verbs. Let
us carefully examine the meaning of these <i>three kinds</i> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
see if there is any occasion for such a division; if they have
any foundation in truth, or application in the correct use of
language. We will follow the arrangements adopted by
the most popular grammars.</p>

<p>"A <i>verb active</i> expresses an action, and necessarily implies
an agent, and an object acted upon; as, to love, I love
Penelope." A very excellent definition, indeed! Had
grammarians stopped here, their works would have been
understood, and proved of some service in the study of language.
But when they diverge from this bright spot in the
consideration of verbs&mdash;this oasis in the midst of a desert&mdash;they
soon become lost in the surrounding darkness of conjecture,
and follow each their own dim light, to hit on a
random track, which to follow in the pursuit of their object.</p>

<p>We give our most hearty assent to the above definition
of a verb. It expresses action, which necessarily implies
an <i>actor</i>, and an <i>object</i> influenced by the action. In our
estimation it matters not whether the object on which the
action terminates is expressed or <i>understood</i>. If I <i>love</i>, I
must love some object; either my neighbor, my enemy, my
family, <i>myself</i>, or something else. In either case the <i>action</i>
is the same, tho the objects may be different; and it is regarded,
on all hands, as an active verb. Hence when the
object on which the action terminates is not expressed, it is
necessarily understood. All language is, in this respect,
more or less eliptical, which adds much to its richness and
brevity.</p>

<p>Active verbs, we are told, are divided into <i>transitive</i> and
<i>intransitive</i>. Mr. Murray does not exactly approve of this
distinction, but prefers to class the intransitive and neuter
together. Others, aware of the fallacy of attempting to
make children conceive any thing like neutrality in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
verbs, <i>run</i>, <i>fly</i>, <i>walk</i>, <i>live</i>, &amp;c., have preferred to mark the
distinction and call them <i>in</i>transitive; because, say they, they
do not terminate on any object expressed.</p>

<p>A <i>transitive verb</i> "expresses an action which passes from
the agent to the object; as, C&aelig;sar conquered Pompey."
To this definition we can not consent. It attempts a distinction
where there is none. It is not true in principle, and
can not be adopted in practice.</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar conquered Pompey." Did the act of conquering
pass <i>transitively</i> over from <i>C&aelig;sar</i> to Pompey? They might
not have seen each other during the whole battle, nor been
within many miles of each other. They, each of them,
stood at the head of their armies, and alike gave orders to
their subordinate officers, and they again to their inferiors,
and so down, each man contending valiantly for <i>victory</i>, till,
at last, the fate of the day sealed the downfall of Pompey,
and placed the crown of triumph on the head of C&aelig;sar. The
expression is a correct one, but the action expressed by the
verb "conquered," is not transitive, as that term is understood.
A whole train of causes was put in operation which
finally terminated in the defeat of one, and the conquest of
the other.</p>

<p>"Bonaparte <i>lost</i> the battle of Waterloo." What did <i>he</i>
do to <i>lose</i> the battle? He exerted his utmost skill to <i>gain</i>
the battle and escape defeat. He did not do a single act,
he entertained not a single thought, which lead to such a
result; but strove against it with all his power. If the fault
was <i>his</i>, it was because he failed to act, and not because he
labored to <i>lose</i> the battle. He had too much at stake to
adopt such a course, and no man but a teacher of grammar,
would ever accuse him of <i>acting</i> to <i>lose</i> the battle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"A man was sick; he desired to recover (his health).
He took, for medicine, opium by mistake, and <i>lost</i> his life
by it." Was he guilty of suicide? Certainly, if our grammars
are true. But he <i>lost</i> his life in trying to get well.</p>

<p>"A man in America <i>possesses</i> property in Europe, and
his children <i>inherit</i> it after his death." What do the children
do to <i>inherit</i> this property, of which they know nothing?</p>

<p>"The geese, by their gabbling, <i>saved</i> Rome from destruction."
How did the geese save the city? They made
a noise, which waked the sentinels, who roused the soldiers
to arms; they fought, slew many Gauls, and delivered the
city.</p>

<p>"A man in New-York <i>transacts</i> business in Canton."
How does he do it? He has an agent there to whom he
sends his orders, and he transacts the business. But how
does he get his letters? The clerk writes them, the postman
carries them on board the ship, the captain commands
the sailors, who work the ropes which unfurl the sails, the
wind blows, the vessel is managed by the pilot, and after a
weary voyage of several months, the letters are delivered
to the agent, who does the business that is required of him.</p>

<p>The miser <i>denies</i> himself every comfort, and spends his
whole life in hoarding up riches; and yet he dies and <i>leaves</i>
his gold to be the possession of others.</p>

<p>Christians <i>suffer</i> insults almost every day from the Turks.</p>

<p>Windows <i>admit</i> light and <i>exclude</i> cold.</p>

<p>Who can discover any thing like <i>transitive</i> action&mdash;a
passing from the agent to the object&mdash;in these cases? What
transitive action do the windows perform to <i>admit the light</i>;
or the christians, to <i>suffer insults</i>; or the miser, to <i>leave his
money</i>? If there is neutrality any where, we would look for
it here. The fact is, these words express <i>relative</i> action, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
we shall explain when we come to the examination of the
true character of the verb.</p>

<p><i>Neutrality</i> signifies (transitive verb!) no action, and <i>neuter</i>
verbs <i>express a state of being</i>! A class of words which
can not act, which apply to things in a quiescent state, <i>perform</i>
the transitive action of "<i>expressing</i> a state of being!"</p>

<p>Who does not perceive the inconsistency and folly of such
distinctions? And who has not found himself perplexed, if
not completely bewildered in the dark and intricate labyrinths
into which he has been led by the false grammar
books! Every attempt he has made to extricate himself, by
the dim light of the "simplifiers," has only tended to bewilder
him still more, till he is utterly confounded, or else
abandons the study altogether.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>An <i>intransitive</i> verb "denotes action which is confined to
the actor, and does not pass over to another object; as, I
sit, he lives, they sleep."</p>

<p>"A verb <i>neuter</i> expresses neither action nor passion, but
being, or a state of being; as, I am, I sleep, I sit."</p>

<p>These verbs are nearly allied in character; but we will
examine them separately and fairly. The examples are
the same, with exception of the verb <i>to be</i>, which we will
notice by itself, and somewhat at large, in another place.</p>

<p>Our first object will be
to <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ascertion'">ascertain</ins>
the <i>meaning</i> and use
of the words which have been given as samples of neutrality.
It is unfortunate for the neuter systems that they can
not define a "neuter verb" without making it express an action
which terminates on some object.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"The man <i>sits</i> in his chair."</p>

<p><i>Sits</i>, we are told, is a neuter verb. What does it mean?
The man <i>places</i> himself in a sitting posture in his <i>seat</i>. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<i>keeps</i> himself in his chair by muscular energy, assisted by
gravitation. The chair <i>upholds</i> him in that condition. Bring
a small child and <i>sit</i> it (active verb,) in a chair beside him.
Can it <i>sit</i>? No; it falls upon the floor and is injured. Why
did it fall? It was not able to <i>keep</i> itself from falling. The
lady fainted and <i>fell</i> from her <i>seat</i>. If there is no action in
sitting, why did she not remain as she was? A company of
ladies and gentlemen from the boarding school and college,
entered the parlor of a teacher of neuter verbs; and he
asked them to <i>sit</i> down, or be <i>seated</i>. They were neutral.
He called them impolite. But they replied, that <i>sit</i> "expresses
neither action nor passion," and hence he could not
expect them to occupy his seats.</p>

<p>"<i>Sit</i> or <i>set</i> it away; <i>sit</i> near me; <i>sit</i> farther along; <i>sit</i>
still;" are expressions used by every teacher in addressing
his scholars. On the system we are examining, what would
they understand by such inactive expressions? Would he
not correct them for disobeying his orders? But what did
he order them to do? Nothing at all, if <i>sit</i> denotes no action.</p>

<p>"<i>I sleep.</i>"</p>

<p>Is sleep a neuter verb? So we are gravely told by our
authors. Can grammarians follow their own rules? If so,
they may spend the "live long night" and "its waking
hours," without resorting to "tired nature's sweet restorer,
balmy sleep;" for there is no process under heaven whereby
they can procure sleep, unless they <i>sleep</i> it. For one, I
can never <i>sleep</i> without sleeping <i>sleep</i>&mdash;sometimes only a
short <i>nap</i>. It matters not whether the object is expressed
or not. The action remains the same. The true object is
necessarily understood, and it would be superfluous to name
it. Cases, however, often occur where, both in speaking
and writing, it becomes indispensable to mention the object.
"The stout hearted have <i>slept</i> their sleep." "They shall
<i>sleep</i> the <i>sleep</i> of death." "They shall <i>sleep</i> the perpetual
<i>sleep</i>, and shall not awake." "<i>Sleep</i> on now and <i>take</i> your
rest." The child was troublesome and the mother sung it
to sleep, and it <i>slept itself</i> quiet. A lady took opium and
<i>slept herself</i> to death. "Many persons sleep themselves
into a kind of unnatural stupidity." Rip Van Winkle, according
to the legend, <i>slept</i> away a large portion of a common
life.</p>

<p>Was your sleep refreshing last night? How did you procure
it? Let a person who still adheres to his <i>neuter</i> verbs,
that sleep expresses no action, and has no object on which
it terminates, put his theory in practice; he may as well
sleep with his eyes open, sitting up, as to <i>lie himself</i> upon his
bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
A man lodged in an open chamber, and while he was
<i>sleeping</i> (doing nothing) he <i>caught</i> a severe <i>cold</i> (active
transitive verb) and had a long <i>run</i> of the fever. Who
does not see, not only the bad, but also the false philosophy
of such attempted distinctions? How can you make a child
discover any difference in the <i>act of sleeping</i>, whether there
is an object after it, or not? Is it not the same? And is not
the object necessarily implied, whether expressed or not?
Can a person <i>sleep</i>, without procuring <i>sleep</i>?</p>

<p>"<i>I stand.</i>"</p>

<p>The man <i>stands</i> firm in his integrity. Another stands in
a very precarious condition, and being unable to retain his
hold, <i>falls</i> down the precipice and is killed. Who is killed?
The man, surely. Why did he fall? Because he could not
<i>stand</i>. But there is no <i>action</i> in <i>standing</i>, say the books.</p>

<p>"<i>Stand</i> by thyself, come not near me?" "<i>Stand</i> fast
in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and <i>be</i>
not again entangled in the yoke of bondage." "Let him
that thinketh he <i>standeth</i>, take heed lest he <i>fall</i>." If it requires
no act to <i>stand</i>, there can be no danger of falling.</p>

<p>"Two pillars stood together; the rest had fallen to the
ground. The one on the right was quite perfect in all its
parts. The other <i>resembled it</i> very much, except it had <i>lost</i>
its capital, and <i>suffered</i> some other injuries." How could
the latter column, while performing no action in <i>standing</i>,
act <i>transitively</i>, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'acording'">according</ins>
to our grammars, and do something
to <i>resemble</i> the other? or, what did it do to <i>lose</i> its capital,
and <i>suffer</i> other injury?</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"To <i>lie</i>, or <i>lay</i>."</p>

<p>It has been admitted that the verbs before considered are
often used as active verbs, and that there is, in truth, action
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
expressed by them. But when the man has fallen from his
seat and <i>lies</i> upon the floor, it is contended that he no longer
acts, and that <i>lie</i> expresses no action. He has ceased
from physical, muscular action regulated by his will, and
is now subject to the common laws which govern matter.</p>

<p>Let us take a strong example. The book <i>lies</i> or <i>lays</i>
on the desk. Now you ask, does that book perform any
action in laying on the desk? I answer, yes; and I will
prove it on the principles of the soundest philosophy, to the
satisfaction of every one present. Nor will I deviate from
existing grammars to do it, so far as real action is concerned.</p>

<p>The book <i>lies</i> on the desk. The desk <i>supports</i> the book.
Will you parse <i>supports</i>? It is, according to every system,
an active transitive verb. It has an objective case after it
on which the action terminates. But what does the desk
do to <i>support</i> the book? It barely resists the action which
the book <i>performs</i> in lying on it. The action of the desk
and book is reciprocal. But if the book does not act, neither
can the desk act, for that only repels the force of the
book in pressing upon it in its tendency towards the earth,
in obedience to the law of gravitation. And yet our authors
have told us that the desk is <i>active</i> in resisting no action
of the book! No wonder people are unable to understand
grammar. It violates the first principles of natural
science, and frames to itself a code of laws, unequal, false,
and exceptionable, which bear no affinity to the rest of the
world, and will not apply in the expression of ideas.</p>

<p>I was once lecturing on this subject in one of the cities of
New-York. Mrs. W., the distinguished teacher of one of
the most popular Female Seminaries in our country, attended.
At the close of one lecture she remarked that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
greatest fault she had discovered in the new system, was
the want of a class of words to express neutrality. Children,
she said, conceived ideas of things in a quiescent state,
and words should be taught them by which to communicate
such ideas. I asked her for an example. She gave the
rock in the side of the mountain. It had never moved. It
could never act. There it had been from the foundation
of the earth, and there it would remain unaltered and unchanged
till time should be no longer. I remarked, that I
would take another small stone and <i>lay</i> it on the great one
which could never act, and now we say the great rock <i>upholds</i>,
<i>sustains</i> or <i>supports</i> the small one&mdash;all active transitive
verbs with an object expressed.</p>

<p>She replied, she would give it up, for it had satisfied her
of a new principle which must be observed in the exposition
of all language, which accords with <i>facts as developed in
physical and mental science</i>.</p>

<p>I continued, not only does that rock act in resisting the
force of the small one which lays upon it, but, by the attraction
of gravitation it is able to <i>maintain</i> its <i>position</i> in
the side of the mountain; by cohesion it <i>retains</i> its distinct
identity and solidity, and repels all foreign bodies. It is
also subject to the laws which govern the earth in its diurnal
and annual revolutions, and moves in common with other
matter at the astonishing rate of a thousand miles in an
hour! Who shall teach children, in these days of light
and improvement, the grovelling doctrine of neutrality, this
relic of the peripatetic philosophy? Will parents send their
children to school to learn falsehood? And can teachers
be satisfied to remain in ignorance, following with blind
reverence the books they have studied, and refuse to examine
new principles, fearing they shall be compelled to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
acknowledge former errors and study new principles?
They should remember it is wiser and more honorable to
confess a fault and correct it, than it is to remain permanent
in error.</p>

<p>Let us take another example of the verb "<i>to lie</i>." A
country pedagogue who has followed his authorities most
devotedly, and taught his pupils that <i>lie</i> is a "<i>neuter verb</i>,
expressing neither action nor passion, but simply being, or
a state of being," goes out, during the intermission, into a
grove near by, to <i>exercise himself</i>. In attempting to roll a
log up the hill, he <i>makes</i> a mis-step, and <i>falls</i> (intransitive
verb, <i>nothing</i> falls!) to the ground, and the log <i>rolls</i> (<i>nothing</i>)
on to him, and <i>lies</i> across his legs. In this condition
he is observed by his scholars to whom he cries (nothing)
for help. "Do (nothing) come (intransitive) and help me."
They obey him and remain <i>neuter</i>, or at least act <i>intransitively</i>,
and produce no effects. He cries again for help
and his <i>cries</i> are regarded. They <i>present</i> themselves before
him. "Do roll this log off; it will break my legs."
"Oh no, master; how can that be? The log <i>lies</i> on you,
does it not?" "Yes, and it will <i>press me</i> to death." "No,
no; that can never be. The log can not act. <span class="smcap">Lies</span> is a
<i>neuter</i> verb, signifying neither <i>action</i> nor passion, but simply
being or a state of being. You have a <i>state</i> of being,
and the log has a state of being. It can not harm you.
You must have forgotten the practical application of the
truths you have been teaching us." It would be difficult
to explain neuter verbs in such a predicament.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now I <i>lay</i> me down <i>to sleep</i>."</p></div>

<p>"She died and they <i>laid her</i> beside her lover under the
spreading branches of the willow."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
"They <i>laid it</i> away so secure that they could never find
it."</p>

<p>They <i>laid</i> down to <i>rest themselves</i> after the fatigue of a
whole day's journey.</p>

<p>We have now considered the model verbs of the neuter
kind, with the exception of the verb <span class="smcap">to be</span>, which is left for
a distinct consideration, being the most active of all verbs.
It is unnecessary to spend much time on this point. The
errors I have examined have all been discovered by teachers
of language, long ago, but few have ventured to correct
them. An alleviation of the difficulty has been sought in
the adoption of the intransitive verb, which "expresses an action
that is confined to the actor or agent."</p>

<p>The remarks which have been given in the present lecture
will serve as a hint to the course we shall adopt in
treating of them, but the more particular examination of
their character and uses, together with some general observation
on the agents and objects of verbs, will be deferred
to our next lecture.</p>

<p>We resume the consideration of verbs. We closed our
last lecture with the examination of <i>neuter verbs</i>, as they
have been called. It appears to us that evidence strong
enough to convince the most skeptical was adduced to prove
that <i>sit</i>, <i>sleep</i>, <i>stand</i> and <i>lie</i>, stand in the same relation to
language as other verbs, that they do not, in any case, express
neutrality, but frequently admit an objective word after
them. These are regarded as the most neutral of all
the verbs except <i>to be</i>, which, by the way, expresses the
highest degree of action, as we shall see when we come to
inquire into its meaning.</p>

<p>Grammarians have long ago discovered the falsity of the
books in the use of a large portion of verbs which have
been called neuter. To obviate the difficulty, some of them
have adopted the distinction of <i>Intransitive</i> verbs, which express
action, but terminate on no object; others still use the
term <i>neuter</i>, but teach their scholars that when the <i>object</i> is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<i>expressed</i>, it is active. This distinction has only tended to
perplex learners, while it afforded only a temporary expedient
to teachers, by which to dodge the question at issue.
So far as the action is concerned, which it is the business of
the verb to express, what is the difference whether "I <i>run</i>,
or <i>run</i> myself?" "A man started in haste. He <i>ran</i> so fast
that he <i>ran himself</i> to death." I strike Thomas, Thomas
<i>strikes David</i>, Thomas <i>strikes himself</i>. Where is the difference
in the action? What matters it whether the action
passes over to another object, or is confined within itself?</p>

<p>"But," says the objector, "you mistake. An intransitive
verb is one where the 'effect is confined within the subject,
and does not pass over to any object.'"</p>

<p>Very well, I think I understand the objection. When
Thomas strikes David the effects of the blow <i>passes over</i> to
him. And when he strikes himself, it "is confined within
the subject," and hence the latter is an <i>intransitive</i> verb.</p>

<p>"No, no; there is an object on which the action terminates,
in that case, and so we must call it a <i>transitive</i> verb."</p>

<p>Will you give me an example of an <i>intransitive</i> verb?</p>

<p>"I <i>run</i>, he <i>walks</i>, birds <i>fly</i>, it <i>rains</i>, the fire <i>burns</i>. No
objects are expressed after these words, so the action is
confined within themselves."</p>

<p>I now get your meaning. When the object is <i>expressed</i>
the verb is transitive, when it is not it is intransitive. This
distinction is generally observed in teaching, however widely
it may differ from the intention of the makers of grammars.
And hence children acquire the habit of limiting
their inquiries to what they see placed before them by others,
and do not think for themselves. When the verb has
an objective word after it <i>expressed</i>, they are taught to attach
action to it; but tho the action may be even greater,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
if the object is not expressed, they consider the action as
widely different in its character, and adopt the false philosophy
that a cause can exist without an effect resulting
from it.</p>

<p>We assume this ground, and we shall labor to maintain
it, that every verb necessarily presupposes an <i>agent</i> or <i>actor</i>,
an <i>action</i>, and an <i>object</i> acted upon, or affected by the
action.</p>

<p>No action, as such, can be known to exist separate from
the thing that acts. We can conceive no idea of action,
only by keeping our minds fixed on the acting substance,
marking its changes, movements, and tendencies. "The
book <i>moves</i>." In this case the eye rests on the book, and
observes its positions and attitudes, alternating one way and
the other. You can separate no action from the book, nor
conceive any idea of it, as a separate entity. Let the
book be taken away. Where now is the action? What
can you think or say of it? There is the same space just
now occupied by the book, but no action is perceivable.</p>

<p>The boy <i>rolls</i> his marble upon the floor. All his ideas
of the action performed by it are derived from an observation
of the marble. His eye follows it as it moves along
the floor. He sees it in that acting condition. When he
speaks of the action as a whole, he thinks where it started
and where it stopped. It is of no importance, so far as the
verb is concerned, whether the marble received an impulse
from his hand, or whether the floor was sufficiently inclined
to allow it to roll by its own inherent tendency. The action
is, in this case, the obvious change of the marble.</p>

<p>Our whole knowledge of action depends on an observance
of things in a state of motion, or change, or exerting a
tendency to change, or to counteract an opposing substance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
This will be admitted so far as material things are concerned.
The same principle holds good in reference to every thing
of which we form ideas, or concerning which we
use language. In our definition of nouns we spoke of immaterial
and imaginary things to which we gave <i>names</i> and
which we consider as agencies capable of exerting an influence
in the production of effects, or in resisting actions. It
is therefore unimportant whether the action be real or imaginary.
It is still inseparably connected with the thing
that acts; and we employ it thus in the construction of language
to express our thoughts. Thus, lions roar; birds
sing; minds reflect; fairies dance; knowledge increases;
fancies err; imagination wanders.</p>

<p>This fact should be borne in mind in all our attempts to
understand or explain language. The mind should remain
fixed to the acting substance, to observe its changes and
relations at different periods, and in different circumstances.
There is no other process by which any knowledge can be
gained of actions. The mind contemplates the acting thing
in a condition of change and determines the precise action
by the <i>altered condition</i> of the thing, and thus learns to
judge of actions by their effects. The only method by
which we can know whether a <i>vegetable grows</i> or not is by
comparing its form to-day with what it was some days ago.
We can not decide on the improvement of our children only
by observing the same rule.</p>

<p>"By their fruits ye shall know them," will apply in
physics as well as in morals; for we judge of causes only
by their effects. First principles can never be known.
We observe things as they <i>are</i>, and remember how they
<i>have been</i>; and from hence deduce our conclusions in reference
to the <i>cause</i> of things we do not fully understand, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
those consequences which will follow a condition of things
as now existing. It is the business of philosophy to mark
these effects, and trace them back to the causes which produced
them, by observing all the intermediate changes,
forms, attitudes, and conditions, in which such things have,
at different times, been placed.</p>

<p>We say, "<i>trees grow</i>." But suppose no change had
ever been observed in trees, that they had always been as
they now are; in stature as lofty, in foliage as green and
beautiful, in location unaltered. Who would then say,
"trees grow?"</p>

<p>In this single expression a whole train of facts are taken
into the account, tho not particularly marked. As a single
expression we imply that <i>trees increase their stature</i>. But
this we all know could never be effected without the influence
of other causes. The soil where it stands must contain
properties suited to the <i>growth</i> of the tree. A due
portion of moisture and heat are also requisite. These facts
all exist, and are indispensable to make good the expression
that the "tree grows." We might also trace the capabilities
of the tree itself, its roots, bark, veins or pores, fibres or
grains, its succulent and absorbent powers. But, as in the
case of the "man that killed the deer," noticed in a former
lecture, the mind here conceives a single idea of a complete
whole, which is signified by the single expression, "trees
grow."</p>

<p>Let the following example serve in further illustration of
this point. Take two bricks, the one heated to a high temperature,
the other cold. Put them together, and in a short
time you will find them of equal temperature. One has
grown warm, the other cool. One has <i>imparted</i> heat and
<i>received</i> cold, the other has <i>received</i> heat and <i>imparted</i> cold.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Yet all this would remain forever unknown, but for the effects
which must appear obvious to all. From these effects
the causes are to be learned.</p>

<p>It must, I think, appear plain to all who are willing to
see, that action, as such, can never exist distinct from the
thing that acts; that all our notions of action are derived
from an observance of <i>things</i> in an acting condition; and
hence that no words can be framed to express our ideas of
action on any other principle.</p>

<p>I hope you will bear these principles in mind. They are
vastly important in the construction of language, as will
appear when we come to speak of the <i>agents</i> and <i>objects</i> of
action. We still adhere to the fact, that no rules of language
can be successfully employed, which deviate from
the permanent laws which operate in the regulation of matter
and mind; a fact which can not be too deeply impressed
on your minds.</p>

<p>In the consideration of actions as expressed by verbs,
we must observe that <i>power</i>, <i>cause</i>, <i>means</i>, <i>agency</i>, and
<i>effects</i>, are indispensable to their existence. Such principles
exist <i>in fact</i>, and must be observed in obtaining a complete
knowledge of language; for words, we have already
seen, are the expression of ideas, and ideas are the impression
of things.</p>

<p>In our attempts at improvement, we should strip away
the covering, and come at the reality. Words should be
measurably forgotten, while we search diligently for the
things expressed by them. <i>Signs</i> should always conduct
to the things <i>signified</i>. The weary traveller, hungry and
faint, would hardly satisfy himself with an examination of
the <i>sign</i> before the inn, marking its form, the picture upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
it, the nice shades of coloring in the painting. He would
go in, and search for the thing signified.</p>

<p>It has been the fault in teaching language, that learners
have been limited to the mere <i>forms</i> of words, while the
important duty of teaching them to look at the thing signified,
has been entirely disregarded. Hence they have only
obtained book knowledge. They know what the grammars
say; but how to <i>apply</i> what they say, or what is in reality
meant by it, they have yet to learn. This explains the
reason why almost every man who has studied grammar
will tell you that "he <i>used</i> to understand it, but it has all
gone from him, for he has not looked into a <i>book</i> these many
years." Has he lost a knowledge of language? Oh, no,
he learned that before he saw a grammar, and will preserve
it to the day of his death. What good did his two or three
years study of grammar do him? None at all; he has
forgotten all that he ever knew of it, and that is not much,
for he only learned what some author said, and a few arbitrary
rules and technical expressions which he could never
understand nor apply in practice, except in special cases.
But I wander. I throw in this remark to show you the
necessity of bringing your minds to a close observance of
things as they do in truth exist; and from them you can
draw the principles of speech, and be able to use language
correctly. For we still insist on our former opinion, that
all language depends on the permanent laws of nature, as
exerted in the regulation of matter and mind.<br /><br /></p>

<p>To return. I have said that all action denotes <i>power</i>,
<i>cause</i>, <i>means</i>, <i>agency</i>, and <i>effects</i>.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Power</i> depends on <i>physical energy</i>, or <i>mental skill</i>. I
have hinted at this fact before. Things act according to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the power or energy they possess. Animals walk, birds
fly, fishes swim, minerals sink, poisons kill. Or, according
to the adopted theories of naturalists:</p>

<p>Minerals <i>grow</i>.</p>

<p>Vegetables <i>grow</i> and <i>live</i>.</p>

<p>Animals <i>grow</i>, and <i>live</i>, and <i>feel</i>.</p>

<p>Every thing acts according to the ability it possesses.
Man, possessed of reason, devises means and produces ends.
Beasts change locations, devour vegetables, and sometimes
other beasts. The lowest grade of animals never change
location, but yet eat and live. Vegetables live and grow,
but do not change location. They have the power to reproduce
their species, and some of them to kill off surrounding
objects. "The <i>carraguata</i> of the West Indies, clings
round," says Goldsmith, "whatever tree it happens to approach;
there it quickly gains the ascendant, and, loading
the tree with a verdure not its own, keeps away that nourishment
designed to feed the trunk, and at last entirely destroys
its supporter." In our country, many gardens and
fields present convincing proof of the ability of weeds to
kill out the vegetables designed to grow therein. You all
have heard of the <i>Upas</i>, which has a power sufficient to
destroy the lives of animals and vegetables for a large distance
around. Its very exhalations are death to whatever
approaches it. It serves in metaphor to illustrate the noxious
effects of all vice, of slander and deceit, the effects of
which are to the moral constitution, what the tree itself is
to natural objects, blight and mildew upon whatever comes
within its reach.</p>

<p>Minerals are possessed of <i>power</i> no less astonishing, which
may be observed whenever an opportunity is offered to call
it forth. Active poisons, able to slay the most powerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
men and beasts, lie hid within their bosoms. They have
strong attractive and repelling powers. From the iron is
made the strong cable which <i>holds</i> the vessel fast in her
moorings, <i>enabling</i> it to outride the collected force of the
winds and waves which <i>threaten</i> its destruction. From it
also are manufactured the manacles which bind the strong
man, or fasten the lion in his cage. Gold <i>possesses</i> a power
which <i>charms</i> nearly all men to sacrifice their ease, and
too many their moral principles, to pay their blind devotions
at its shrine.</p>

<p>Who will contend that the power of action is confined to
the animal creation alone, and that inanimate matter can
not act? That there is a superior power possessed by man,
endowed with an immaterial spirit in a corporeal body, none
will deny. By the agency of the mind he can accomplish
wonders, which mere physical power without the aid of
such mental skill, could never perform. But with all his
boasted superiority, he is often made the slave of inanimate
things. His lofty powers of body and soul bend beneath
the weight of accumulated sorrows, produced by the secret
<i>operations</i> of contagious disease, which <i>slays</i> his wife, children,
and friends, who fall like the ripened harvest before
the gatherers scythe. Nay, he often submits to the controlling
power of the vine, alcohol, or tobacco, which <i>gain</i>
a secret influence over his nobler powers, and <i>fix</i> on him
the stamp of disgrace, and <i>throw</i> around him fetters from
which he finds it no easy matter to extricate himself. By
the illusions of error and vice he is often betrayed, and long
endures darkness and suffering, till he <i>regains</i> his native
energies, and finds deliverance in the enjoyment of truth
and virtue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
What is that secret power which lies concealed beyond
the reach of human ken, and is transported from land to
land unknown, till exposed in conditions suited to its operation,
will show its active and resistless force in the destruction
of life, and the devastation of whole cities or nations?
You may call it plague, or cholera, or small pox, miasma,
contagion, particles of matter floating in the air surcharged
with disease, or any thing else. It matters not what you
call it. It is sufficient to our present purpose to know that
it has the ability to put forth a prodigious power in the production
of consequences, which the highest skill of man is
yet unable to prevent.</p>

<p>I might pursue this point to an indefinite length, and trace
the secret powers possessed by all created things, as exhibited
in the influence they exert in various ways, both as
regards themselves and surrounding objects. But you will
at once perceive my object, and the truth of the positions
I assume. A common power pervades all creation, operating
by pure and perfect laws, regulated by the Great First
Cause, the Moving Principle, which guides, governs, and
controls the whole.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Degrading indeed must be those sentiments which limit
all action to the animal frame as an organized body, moved
by a living principle. Ours is a sublimer duty; to trace
the operations of the Divine Wisdom which acts thro out all
creation, in the minutest particle of dust which <i>keeps</i> its
<i>position</i> secure, till moved by some superior power; or in
the <i>needle</i> which points with unerring skill to its fixed point,
and <i>guides</i> the vessel, freighted with a hundred lives, safe
thro the midnight storm, to its destined haven; tho rocked
by the waves and driven by the winds, it remains uninfluenced,
and tremblingly alive to the important duties entrusted
to its charge, continues its faithful service, and is
watched with the most implicit confidence by all on board,
as the only guide to safety. The same Wisdom is displayed
thro out all creation; in the beauty, order, and harmony
of the universe; in the planets which float in the
azure vault of heaven; in the glow worm that glitters in
the dust; in the fish which cuts the liquid element; in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
pearl which sparkles in the bottom of the ocean; in every
thing that lives, moves, or has a being; but more distinctly
in man, created in the moral image of his Maker, possessed
of a heart to feel, and a mind to understand&mdash;the third in
the rank of intelligent beings.</p>

<p>I cannot refuse to favor you with a quotation from that
inimitable poem, Pope's Essay on Man. It is rife with sentiment
of the purest and most exalted character. It is direct
to our purpose. You may have heard it a thousand
times; but I am confident you will be pleased to hear it
again.</p>

<p>But <i>power</i> alone is not sufficient to produce action.
There must be a <span class="smcap">cause</span> to call it forth, to set in operation
and exhibit its latent energies. It will remain hid in its
secret chambers till efficient causes have set in operation
the <i>means</i> by which its existence is to be discovered in the
production of change, effects, or results. There is, it is
said, in every created thing a power sufficient to produce
its own destruction, as well as to preserve its being. In
the human body, for instance, there is a constant tendency
to decay, to waste; which a counteracting power resists,
and, with proper assistance, keeps alive.</p>

<p>The same may be said of vegetables which are constantly
throwing off, or exhaling the waste, offensive, or useless
matter, and yet a restoring power, assisted by heat, moisture,
and the nourishment of the earth, resists the tendency
to decay and preserves it alive and growing. The air, the
earth, nay, the ocean itself, philosophers assure us, contain
powers sufficient to self-destruction. But I will not enlarge
here. Let the necessary <i>cause</i> be exerted which will give
vent to this hidden power and actions the most astonishing
and destructive would be the effect. These are often witnessed
in the tremendous earthquakes which devastate
whole cities, states, and empires; in the tornados which
pass, like the genius of evil, over the land, levelling whatever
is found in its course; or in the waterspouts and maelstroms
which prove the grave of all that comes within their
grasp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
In the attempted destruction of the royal family and parliament
of England, by what is usually called the "gunpowder
plot," the arrangements were all made; two hogsheads
and thirty-six barrels of powder, sufficient to blow up the
house of lords and the surrounding buildings, were secreted
in a vault beneath it, strown over with faggots. Guy
Fawkes, a spanish officer, employed for the purpose, lay at
the door, on the 5th of November, 1605, with the matches,
or <i>means</i>, in his pocket, which should set in operation the
prodigious dormant <i>power</i>, which would hurl to destruction
James I., the royal family, and the protestant parliament,
give the ascendancy to the Catholics, and change the whole
political condition of the nation. The <i>project</i> was discovered,
the <i>means</i> were removed, the <i>cause</i> taken away, and the
threatened <i>effects</i> were prevented.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">cause</span> of action is the immediate subject which precedes
or tends to produce the action, without which it would
not take place. It may result from volition, inherent tendency,
or communicated impulse; and is known to exist
from the effects produced by it, in the altered or new condition
of the thing on which it operates; which change
would not have been effected without it.</p>

<p>Causes are to be sought for by tracing back thro the effects
which are produced by them. The factory is put in
operation, and the cloth is manufactured. The careless observer
would enter the building and see the spindles, looms,
and wheels operated by the hands, and go away satisfied
that he has seen enough, seen all. But the more careful
will look farther. He will trace each band and wheel, each
cog and shaft, down by the balance power, to the water
race and floom; or thro the complicated machinery of the
steam engine to the piston, condenser, water, wood, and fire;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
marking a new, more secret, and yet more efficient cause at
each advancing step. But all this curiously wrought machinery
is not the product of chance, operated without care.
A superior cause must be sought in human skill, in the deep
and active ingenuity of man. Every contrivance presupposes
a contriver. Hence there must have been a power
and means sufficient to combine and regulate the power of
the water, or generate and direct the steam. That power
is vested in man; and hence, man stands as the cause, in
relation to the whole process operated by wheels, bands,
spindles, and looms. Yet we may say, with propriety, that
the water, or the steam; the water-wheel, or the piston;
the shafts, bands, cogs, pullies, spindles, springs, treddles, harnesses,
reeds, shuttles, an almost endless concatenation of instruments,
are alike the <i>causes</i>, which tend to produce the
final result; for let one of these intermediate causes be removed,
and the whole power will be diverted, and all will
go wrong&mdash;the effect will not be produced.</p>

<p>There must be a <span class="smcap">first cause</span> to set in operation all inferior
ones in the production of action; and to that <i>first</i> cause
all action, nay, the existence of all other causes, may be
traced, directly, or more distant. The intervening causes, in
the consecutive order of things, may be as diversified as the
links in the chain of variant beings. Yet all these causes
are moved by the all-sufficient and ever present agency of
the Almighty Father, the <span class="smcap">Uncaused Cause</span> of all things
and beings; who spoke into existence the universe with all
its various and complicated parts and orders; who set the
sun, moon, and stars in the firmament, gave the earth a
place, and fixed the sea a bed; throwing around them barriers
over which they can never pass. From the height of
his eternal throne, his eye pervades all his works; from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
tall archangel, that "adores and burns," down to the very
hairs of our heads, which are all numbered, his wise, benevolent,
and powerful supervision may be traced in legible
lines, which may be seen and read of all men. And from
effects, the most diminutive in character, may be traced back,
from cause to cause, upward in the ascending scale of being,
to the same unrivalled Source of all power, splendor,
and perfection, the presence of Him, who spake, and it was
done; who commanded, and it <i>stood still</i>; or, as the poet
has it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Look thro nature up to nature's God."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>means</i> of action are those aids which are displayed
as the medium thro which existing causes are to exhibit
their hidden powers in producing changes or effects. The
matches in the pocket of
Guy <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fawks'">Fawkes</ins> were the direct means
by which he intended to set in operation a train of causes
which should terminate in the destruction of the house of
lords and all its inmates. Those matches, set on fire, would
convey a spark to the faggots, and thence to the powder,
and means after means, and cause after cause, in the rapid
succession of events, would ensue, tending to a final, inevitable,
and melancholy result.</p>

<p>A ball shot from a cannon, receives its first impulse from
the powder; but it is borne thro the air by the aid of a principle
inherent in itself, which power is finally overcome by
the density of the atmosphere which impedes its progress,
and the law of gravitation finally attracts it to the earth.
These contending principles may be known by observing the
curved line in which the ball moves from the cannon's mouth
to the spot where it rests. But if there is no power in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ball, why does not the ball of cork discharged from the same
gun with the same momentum, travel to the same distance,
at the same rate? The action commences in both cases
with the same projectile force, the same exterior <i>means</i> are
employed, but the results are widely different. The cause
of this difference must be sought for in the comparative
power of each substance to <i>continue its own movements</i>.</p>

<p>Every boy who has played at ball has observed these
principles. He throws his ball, which, if not <i>counteracted</i>,
will continue in a straight line, <i>ad infinitum</i>&mdash;without end.
But the air impedes its progress, and gravitation brings it to
the ground. When he throws it against a hard substance, its
velocity is not only overcome, but it is sent back with great
force. But if he takes a ball of wax, of snow, or any strong
adhesive substance, it will not bound. How shall we account
to him for this difference? He did the same with both
balls. The impetus given the one was as great as the other,
and the resistance of the intervening substance was as great
in one case as the other; and yet, one bounds and rebounds,
while the other sticks fast as a friend, to the first object it
meets. The cause of this difference is to be sought for in
the different capabilities of the respective balls. One possesses
a strong elastic and repelling power; in the other,
the attraction of cohesion is predominant.</p>

<p>Take another example. Let two substances of equal
size and form, the one made of lead, the other of cork, be
put upon the surface of a cistern of water. The external
circumstances are the same, but the effects are widely different&mdash;one
sinks, the other floats. We must look for the
cause of this difference, not in the opposite qualities of surrounding
matter, but in the things themselves. If you add
to the cork another quality possessed by the lead, and give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
it the same form, size, and <i>weight</i>, it will as readily sink to
the bottom. But this last property is possessed in different
degrees by the two bodies, and hence, while the one floats
upon the water, the other displaces its particles and sinks to
the bottom. You may take another substance; say the
mountain ebony, which is heavier than water, but lighter
than lead, and immerse it in the water; it will not sink with
the rapidity of lead, because its inherent <i>power</i> is not so
strong.</p>

<p>Take still another case. Let two balls, suspended on
strings, be equally, or, to use the technical term, <i>positively</i>
electrified. Bring them within a certain distance, and they
will repel each other. Let the electric fluid be extracted
from one, and the other will attract it. Before, they were
as enemies; now they embrace as friends. The magnet
furnishes the most striking proof in favor of the theory we
are laboring to establish. Let one of sufficient power be
let down within the proper distance, it will overcome the
power of gravitation, and <i>attract</i> the heavy steel to itself.
What is the cause of this wonderful fact? Who can account
for it? Who can trace out the hidden cause; the "<i>primum
mobile</i>" of the Ptolmaic philosophy&mdash;the secret spring of motion?
But who will dare deny that such effects do exist,
and that they are produced by an efficient cause? Or who
will descend into the still more dark and perplexing mazes
of neuter verb grammars, and deny that matter has such a
power to act?</p>

<p>These instances will suffice to show you what we mean
when we say, <i>every thing acts according to the ability God
has given it to act</i>. I might go into a more minute examination
of the properties of matter, affinity, hardness, weight,
size, color, form, mobility, &amp;c., which even old grammars
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
will allow it to <i>possess</i>; but I shall leave that work for you
to perform at your leisure.</p>

<p>Whoever has any doubts remaining in reference to the
abilities of all things to <i>produce</i>, <i>continue</i>, or <i>prevent</i> motion,
will do well to consult the prince of philosophers, Sir Isaac
Newton, who, after Gallileo, has treated largely upon the
laws of motion. He asserts as a fact, full in illustration of
the principles I am laboring to establish, that in ascending
a hill, the trace rope pulls the horse back as much as he
draws that forward, only the horse overcomes the resistance
of the load, and moves it up the hill. On the old systems,
no power would be requisite to move the load, for it
could oppose no resistance to the horse; and the small child
could move it with as much ease as the strong team.</p>

<p>Who has not an acquaintance sufficiently extensive to
know these things? I can not believe there is a person present,
who does not fully comprehend my meaning, and discover
the correctness of the ground I have assumed. And
it should be borne in mind, that no collection or arrangement
of words can be composed into a sentence, which do
not obtain their meaning from a connection of things as they
exist and operate in the material and intellectual world, and
that it is not in the power of man to frame a sentence, to
think or speak, but in conformity with these general and
exceptionless laws.</p>

<p>This important consideration meets us at every advancing
step, as if to admonish us to abandon the vain project of
seeking a knowledge of language without an acquaintance
with the great principles on which it depends. To look for
the leading rules of speech in set forms of expression, or in
the capricious customs of any nation, however learned, is
as futile as to attempt to gain a knowledge of the world by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
shutting ourselves up in a room, and looking at paintings
and drawings which may be furnished by those who know
as little of it as we do. How fallacious would be the attempt,
how much worse than time thrown away, for the
parent to shut up his child in a lonely room, and undertake
to impress upon its mind a knowledge of man, beasts, birds,
fish, insects, rivers, mountains, fields, flowers, houses, cities,
&amp;c., with no other aid than a few miserable pictures, unlike
the reality, and in many respects contradictory to each
other. And yet that would be adopting a course very similar
to the one long employed as the only means of acquiring
a knowledge of language; limited to a set of arbitrary, false,
and contradictory rules, which the brightest geniuses could
never understand, nor the most erudite employ in the expression
of ideas. The grammars, it was thought, must be
studied to acquire the use of language, and yet they were
forgotten before such knowledge was put in practice.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>A simple remark on the principles of <i>relative</i> action, and
we will pass to the consideration of <i>agents</i> and <i>objects</i>, or
the more immediate <i>causes</i> and <i>effects</i> of action.</p>

<p>We go forth at the evening hour and look upon the sun
<i>sinking</i> beneath the horizon; we mark the varying hues of
light as they appear, and change, and fade away. We see
the shades of night <i>approaching</i>, with a gradual pace, till
the beautiful landscape on which we had been gazing, the
hills and the meadows; the farm house and the cultivated
fields, the grove, the orchard, and the garden; the tranquil
lake and the babbling brook; the dairy returning home, and
the lambkins gambolling beside their dams; all <i>recede</i> from
our view, and <i>appear</i> to us no longer. All this is <i>relative</i>
action. But so far as language and ideas are concerned, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
matters not whether the sun actually <i>sinks</i> behind the hills,
or the hills interpose between it and us; whether the landscape
<i>recedes</i> from our view, or the shades of night intercept
so as to obscure our vision. The habit of thought is the
same, and the form of expression must agree with it. We
say the sun <i>rises</i> and <i>sets</i>, in reference to the obvious fact,
without stopping to inquire whether it really moves or not.
Nor is such an inquiry at all necessary, as to matter of fact,
for all we mean by such expressions, is, that by some process,
immaterial to the case in hand, the sun stands in a new
relation to the earth, its altitude is elevated or depressed,
and hence the action is strictly relative. For we should
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'rember'">remember</ins>
that <i>rising</i> and <i>setting</i>, <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>, <i>above</i> and <i>below</i>,
in reference to the earth, are only relative terms.</p>

<p>We speak and read of the <i>changes</i> of the moon, and we
correctly understand each other. But in truth the moon
changes no more at one time than at another. The action
is purely relative. One day we observe it <i>before</i> the
sun, and the next <i>behind</i> it, as we understand these terms.
The precise time of the change, when it will appear to us
in a different relation to the sun, is computed by astronomers,
and set down in our almanacs; but it changes no
more at that time than at any other, for like every thing
else, it is <i>always changing</i>.</p>

<p>In a case we mentioned in a former lecture, "John <i>looks</i>
like or <i>resembles</i> his
brother<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original lacks &quot;">,"</ins>
we have an example of relative
action. So in the case of two men travelling the same way,
starting together, but advancing at different rates; one, we
say, <i>falls</i> behind the other. In this manner of expression,
we follow exactly the principles on which we started, and
suit our language to our ideas and habits of thinking. By
the law of optics things are reflected upon the retina of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
eye inversely, that is, upside down; but they are always
seen in a proper relation to each other, and if there is any
thing wrong in the case, it is overcome by early habit; and
so our language accords with things as they are manifested
to our understandings.</p>

<p>These examples will serve to illustrate what we mean by
relative action, when applied to natural philosophy or the
construction of language.</p>

<p>I had intended in this lecture to have treated of the agents
and objects of verbs, to prove, in accordance with the first
and closest principles of philosophy, that every "<i>cause</i> must
have an <i>effect</i>," or, in other words, that every action must
terminate on some object, either expressed or necessarily
understood; but I am admonished that I have occupied
more than my usual quota of time in this lecture already,
and hence I shall leave this work for our next.</p>

<p>I will conclude by the relation of an anecdote or two from
the life of that wonderful man, Gallileo Gallilei, who was
many years professor of mathematics at Padua. Possessed
of a strong, reflecting mind, he had early given his attention
to the observation of things, their motions, tendencies, and
power of resistance, from which he ascended, step by step,
to the sublime science of astronomy. Being of an honest
and frank, as well as benevolent disposition, he shunned not
to state and defend theories at war with the then received
opinions. All learning was, at that time, in the hands or
under the supervision of the ecclesiastics, who were content
to follow blindly the aristotelian philosophy, which, in many
respects, was not unlike that still embraced in our <i>neuter
verb systems</i> of grammar. There was a sworn hostility
against all improvement, or innovation as it was called, in
science as well as in theology. The copernican system,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to which Gallileo was inclined, if it had not been formally
condemned, had been virtually denounced as false, and its
advocates heretical. Hence Gallileo never dared openly
to defend it, but, piece by piece, under different names, he
brought it forth, which, carried out, would establish the heretical
system. Dwelling as a light in the midst of surrounding
darkness, he cautiously discovered the precious
truths revealed to his mind, lest the flood of light should
distract and destroy the mental vision, break up the elements
of society, let loose the resistless powers of ignorance,
prejudice and bigotry, and envelope himself and friends in
a common ruin. At length having prepared in a very
guarded manner his famous "Dialogues on the Ptolmaic and
Copernican Systems," he obtained permission, and ventured
to publish it to the world, altho an edict had been promulgated
enjoining silence on the subject, and he had been
personally instructed "<i>not to believe or teach the motion of
the earth in any manner</i>."</p>

<p>By the false representation of his enemies, suspicions were
aroused and busily circulated prejudicial to Gallileo. Pope
Urban himself, his former friend, became exasperated towards
him, and a sentence against him and his books was
fulminated by the Cardinals, prohibiting the "sale and vending
of the latter, and condemning him to the formal prison
of the Holy Office for a period determined at their pleasure."
The sentence of the Inquisition was in part couched in these
words&mdash;"We pronounce, judge, and declare, that you, the
said Gallileo, by reason of these things, which have been detailed
in the course of this investigation, and which, as above,
you have confessed, have rendered yourself vehemently suspected
by this Holy Office, of heresy; that is to say, that
you believe and hold the false doctrine, and contrary to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Holy and Divine Scriptures, namely, that the sun is the center
of the world, and that it does not <i>move</i> from east to west,
and that the earth does <i>move</i>, and is not the center of the
world; also, that an opinion <i>can be held</i> and <i>supported</i> as
<i>probable</i>, <i>after it has been</i> declared, and finally decreed contrary
to the Holy Scriptures"&mdash;by the Holy See!! "From
which," they continue, "it is <i>our</i> pleasure that you be absolved,
provided that, first, with a <i>sincere</i> heart, and <i>unfeigned
faith</i>, in our presence, you <i>abjure</i>, <i>curse</i>, and <i>detest</i>
the said errors and heresies, and every other error and
heresy contrary to the Catholic and Apostolic Church of
Rome, in the form now shown to you."</p>

<p>After suffering under this anathema some time, Gallileo,
by the advice of his friends, consented to make a public
abjuration of his former heresies on the laws of motion.
Kneeling before the "Most Eminent and Most Reverend
Lords Cardinals, General Inquisitors of the universal Christian
republic, against <i>heretical depravity</i>, having before his
eyes the Holy Gospels," he swears that he always "<i>believed</i>,
and now <i>believes</i>, and with the help of God, <i>will in
future believe</i>, every article which the Holy Catholic Church
of Rome holds, teaches, and preaches"&mdash;that he does altogether
"abandon the false opinion which maintains that the
'sun is the center of the world, and that the earth is <i>not</i> the
center and <i>movable</i>,' that with a sincere heart and unfeigned
faith, he abjures, curses, and detests the said errors and
heresies, and every other error and sect contrary to the
said Holy Church, and that he will never more in future,
say or assert any thing verbally, or in writing, which may
give rise to similar suspicion." As he arose from his knees,
it is said, he whispered to a friend standing near him, "<i>E
pur si muove</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">it does move, tho</span>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
In our times we are not fated to live under the terrors of
the Inquisition; but prejudice, if not as strong in power to
execute, has the ability to blind as truly as in other ages,
and keep us from the knowledge and adoption of practical
improvements. And it is the same philosophy now, which
<i>asks</i> if <i>inanimate matter can act</i>, which <i>demanded</i> of Gallileo
if this ponderous globe could fly a thousand miles in a
minute, and no body feel the motion; and with Deacon
Homespun, in the dialogue, "why, if this world turned upside
down, the water did not spill from the mill ponds, and
all the people fall headlong to the bottomless pit?"</p>

<p>If there are any such peripatetics in these days of light
and science, who still cling to the false and degrading systems
of neutrality, because they are honorable for age, or
sustained by learned and good men, and who will oppose
all improvement, reject without examination, or, what is
still worse, refuse to adopt, after being convinced of the
truth of it, any system, because it is novel, an innovation
upon established forms, I can only say of them, in the language
of Micanzio, the Venetian friend of Gallileo&mdash;"The
efforts of such enemies to get these principles prohibited,
will occasion no loss either to your reputation, or to the intelligent
part of the world. As to posterity, this is just one
of the surest ways to hand them down to them. But what
a wretched set this must be, to whom every good thing, and
<i>all that is found in nature</i>, necessarily appears hostile and
odious."</p>

of false teaching. &mdash; A change is demanded. &mdash; These
principles apply universally. &mdash; Their importance.</p></div>


<p>We have made some general remarks on the power,
cause, and means, necessary in the production of action.
We now approach nearer to the application of these principles
as observed in the immediate <i>agency</i> and <i>effects</i> which
precede and follow action, and as connected with the verb.</p>

<p>It is an axiom in philosophy which cannot be controverted,
that every <i>effect</i> is the product of a prior <i>cause</i>, and
that every <i>cause</i> will necessarily produce a corresponding
<i>effect</i>. This fact has always existed and will forever remain
unchanged. It applies universally in physical, mental,
and moral science; to God or man; to angels or to
atoms; in time or thro eternity. No language can be constructed
which does not accord with it, for no ideas can be
gained but by an observance of its manifestations in the
material or spiritual universe. The manner of <i>expressing</i>
this cause and effect may differ in different nations or by
people of the same nation, but the fact remains unaltered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and so far as understood the idea is the same. In the case
of the horse mentioned in a former
lecture,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the idea was
the same, but the manner of expressing it different. Let
that horse <i>walk</i>, <i>lay</i> down, <i>roll</i> over, <i>rise</i> up, <i>shake</i> himself,
<i>rear</i>, or <i>stand</i> still, all present will observe the same attitude
of the horse, and will form the same ideas of his positions.
Some will doubtless inquire more minutely into the <i>cause</i>
and <i>means</i> by which these various actions are produced,
what muscles are employed, what supports are rendered by
the bones; and the whole regulated by the will of the
horse, and their conclusions may be quite opposite. But
this has nothing to do with the obvious fact expressed by
the words above; or, more properly, it is not necessary to
enter into a minute detail of these minor considerations,
these secret springs of motion, in order to relate the actions
of the horse. For were we to do this we should be required
to go back, step by step, and find the causes still
more numerous, latent, and perplexing. The pursuit of
causes would lead us beyond the mere organization of the
horse, his muscular energy, and voluntary action; for
gravitation has no small service to perform in the accomplishment
of these results; as well as other principles. Let
gravitation be removed, and how could the horse <i>lay</i> down?
He could <i>roll</i> over as well in the air as upon the ground.
But the particular notice of these things is unnecessary in
the construction of language to express the actions of the
horse; for he stands as the obvious <i>agent</i> of the whole, and
the <i>effects</i> are seen to follow&mdash;the <i>horse</i> is laid down, <i>his
body</i> is rolled over, <i>the fore part</i> of it is <i>reared up</i>, <i>himself</i> is
shaken, and the whole <i>feat</i> is produced by the direction of
his master.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Allow me to recal an idea we considered in a former
lecture. I said no action as such could be known distinct
from the thing which acts; that action as such is not perceptible,
and that all things act, according to the ability
they possess. To illustrate this idea: Take a magnet and
lower it down over a piece of iron, till it attracts it to itself
and holds it suspended there. If you are not in possession
of a magnet you can make one at your pleasure, by
the following process. Lay your knife blade on a flat iron,
or any hard, smooth surface; let another take the old tongs
or other iron which have stood erect for a considerable length
of time, and draw it upon the blade for a minute or more.
A magnetic power will be conveyed from the tongs to the
blade sufficient to take up a common needle. The tongs
themselves may be manufactured into a most perfect magnet.
Now as the knife <i>holds</i> the needle suspended beneath
it you perceive there must be an action, a power, and
cause exerted beyond our comprehension. Let the magnetic
power be extracted from the blade, and the needle will
drop to the floor. A common unmagnetized blade will not
<i>raise</i> and <i>hold</i> a needle as this does. How those tongs
come in possession of such astonishing power; by what
process it is there retained; the power and means of transmission
of a part of it to the knife blade, and the reason of
the phenomena you now behold&mdash;an inanimate blade drawing
to itself and there holding this needle suspended&mdash;will
probably long remain unknown to mortals. But that such
are the facts, incontestibly true, none will deny, for the evidence
is before us. Now fix your attention on that needle.
There is an active and <i>acting</i> principle in that as well as in
the magnetized blade; for the blade will not attract a splinter
of wood, of whalebone, or piece of glass, tho equal in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
size and weight. It will have no operation on them. Then
it is by a sort of mutual affinity, a reciprocity of attachment,
between the blade and needle, that this phenomena is
produced.</p>

<p>To apply this illustration you have only to reverse the
case&mdash;turn the knife and needle over&mdash;and see all things
attracted to the earth by the law of gravitation, a principle
abiding in all matter. All that renders the exhibition of the
magnet curious or wonderful is that it is an uncommon condition
of things, an apparent counteraction of the regular
laws of nature. But we should know that the same sublime
principle is constantly operating thro out universal nature.
Let that be suspended, cease its active operations
for a moment, and our own earth will be decomposed into
particles; the sun, moon and stars will dissolve and mingle
with the common dust; all creation will crumble into
atoms, and one vast ocean of darkness and chaos will fill
the immensity of space.</p>

<p>Are you then prepared to deny the principles for which
we are contending? I think you will not; but accede the
ground, that such being the fact, true in nature, language,
correctly explained, is only the medium by which the ideas
of these great truths, may be conveyed from one mind to
another, and must correspond therewith. If language is the
sign of ideas, and ideas are the impressions of things, it
follows of necessity, that no language can be employed unless
it corresponds with these natural laws, or first principles.
The untutored child cannot talk of these things, nor
comprehend our meaning till clearly explained to it. But
some people act as tho they thought children must first
acquire a knowledge of words, and then begin to learn what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
such words mean. This is putting the "cart before the
horse."</p>

<p>Much, in this world, is to be taken for granted. We
can not enter into the minuti&aelig; of all we would express, or
have understood. We go upon the ground that other people
know something as well as we, and that they will exercise
that knowledge while listening to our relation of some
new and important facts. Hence it is said that "brevity is
the soul of wit." But suppose you should talk of surds,
simple and quadratic equations, diophantine problems, and
logarithms, to a person who knows nothing of proportion
or relation, addition or subtraction. What would they know
about your words? You might as well give them a description
in Arabic or Esquimaux. They must first learn
the simple rules on which the whole science of mathematics
depends, before they can comprehend a dissertation on the
more abstruse principles or distant results. So children
must learn to observe things as they are, in their simplest
manifestations, in order to understand the more secret and
sublime operations of nature. And our
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'languge'">language</ins> should always
be adapted to their capacities; that is, it should agree
with their advancement. You may talk to a zealot in politics
of religion, the qualities of forbearance, candor, and
veracity; to the enthusiast of science and philosophy; to
the bigot of liberality and improvement; to the miser of
benevolence and suffering; to the profligate of industry
and frugality; to the misanthrope of philanthropy and patriotism;
to the degraded sinner of virtue, truth, and heaven;
but what do they know of your meaning? How are
they the wiser for your instruction? You have touched a
cord which does not vibrate thro their hearts, or, phrenologically,
addressed an organ they do not possess, except in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a very moderate degree, at least. Food must be seasoned
to the palates of those who use it. Milk is for babes and
strong meat for men. Our instruction must be suited to the
capacities of those we would benefit, always elevated just
far enough above them to attract them along the upward
course of improvement.</p>

<p>But it should be remembered that evils will only result
from a deviation from truth, and that we can never be justified
in doing wrong because others have, or for the sake
of meeting them half way. And yet this very course is
adopted in teaching, and children are learned to adopt certain
technical rules in grammar, not because they are <i>true</i>,
but because they are <i>convenient</i>! In fact, it is said by
some, that language is an arbitrary affair altogether, and is
only to be taught and learned mechanically! But who would
teach children that <i>seven times seven</i> are <i>fifty</i>, and <i>nine
times nine</i> a <i>hundred</i>, and assign as a reason for so doing,
that <i>fifty</i> and a <i>hundred</i> are more easily remembered than
<i>forty-nine</i> and <i>eighty-one</i>? Yet there would be as much
propriety in adopting such a principle in mathematics, as in
teaching for a rule of grammar that when an objective case
comes after a verb, it is active; but when there is none
expressed, it is intransitive or neuter.</p>

<p>The great fault is, grammarians do not allow themselves
to <i>think</i> on the subject of language, or if they do, they only
think intransitively, that is, produce no <i>thoughts</i> by their
cogitations.</p>

<p>This brings us to a more direct consideration of the subject
before us. All admit the correctness of the axiom that
every effect must have a cause, and that every cause will
have an effect. It is equally true that "<i>like causes will
produce like effects</i>," a rule from which nature itself, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
thought, and language, can never deviate. It is as plain as
that two things mutually equal to each other, are equal to
a third. On this immutable principle we base our theory
of the activity of all verbs, and contend that they must have
an object after them, either expressed or <i>necessarily understood</i>.
We can not yield this position till it is proved that
<i>causes</i> can operate without producing effects, which can
never be till the order of creation is reversed! There never
was, to our knowledge, such a thing as an intransitive
action, with the solitary exception of the burning
bush.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In
that case the laws of nature were suspended, and no effects
were produced; for the <i>bush burned</i>, but there was nothing
burnt; no consequences followed to the bush; it was not
consumed. The records of the past present no instance of
like character, where effects have failed to follow, direct or
more distantly, every cause which has been set in operation.</p>

<p>It makes no difference whether the object of the action
is expressed or not. It is the same in either case. But
where it is not necessarily implied from the nature and fitness
of things, it must be expressed, and but for such object
or effect the action could not be understood. For example,
<i>I run</i>; but if there is no effect produced, <i>nothing</i> run, how
can it be known whether I run or not. If I write, it is necessarily
understood that I write <i>something</i>&mdash;a <i>letter</i>, a <i>book</i>,
a <i>piece</i> of poetry, a <i>communication</i>, or some other <i>writing</i>.
When such object is not liable to be mistaken, it would be
superfluous to express it&mdash;it would be a redundancy which
should be avoided by all good writers and speakers. All languages
are, in this respect, more or less eliptical, which constitutes
no small share of their beauty, power, and elegance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
This elipsis may be observed not only in regard to the
objects of verbs, but in the omission of many nouns after
adjectives, which thus assume the character of nouns; as,
the Almighty, the Eternal, the Allwise, applied to God, understood.
So we say the wise, the learned, the good, the
faithful, the wicked, the vile, the base, to which, if nouns, it
would sound rather harsh to apply plurals. So we say,
take your hat off (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); put your gloves on (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); lay your
coat off (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); and pull your boots on (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); presuming the
person so addressed knows enough to fill the elipsis, and
not take his hat off his back, pull his gloves on his feet, or
his boots on his head.</p>

<p>In pursuing this subject farther, let us examine the sample
words which are called <i>intransitive</i> verbs, because frequently
used without the object expressed after them; such
as run, walk, step, fly, rain, snow, burn, roll, shine, smiles,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"<i>I run.</i>"</p>

<p>That here is an action of the first kind, none will deny.
But it is contended by the old systems that there is no object
on which the action terminates. If that be true then
there is <i>nothing</i> run, no effect produced, and the first law of
nature is outraged, in the very onset; for there is a <i>cause</i>,
but no <i>effect</i>; an <i>action</i>, but no <i>object</i>. How is the fact?
Have you run nothing? conveyed nothing, moved nothing
from one place to another? no change, no effect, nothing
moved? Look at it and decide. It is said that a neuter or
intransitive verb may be known from the fact that it takes
after it a preposition. Try it by this rule. "A man run
<i>against</i> a post in a dark night, and broke his neck;" that
is, he run nothing against a post&mdash;no object to run&mdash;and
yet he broke his neck. Unfortunate man!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The fact in relation to this verb is briefly this: It is used
to express the action which more usually terminates on the
actor, than on any other object. This circumstance being
generally known, it would be superfluous to mention the
object, except in cases where such is not the fact. But
whenever we desire to be definite, or when there is the least
liability to mistake the object, it is invariably expressed.
Instances of this kind are numerous. "They <i>ran</i> the <i>boat</i>
ashore." "The captain <i>ran</i> his <i>men</i> to rescue them from
the enemy." "They <i>ran</i> the <i>gauntlet</i>." "They <i>run</i> a
<i>stage</i> to Boston." "He <i>ran himself</i> into discredit." "One
bank <i>runs</i> another." "The man had a hard <i>run</i> of it."
"<i>Run</i> the <i>account</i> over, and see if it is right." "They <i>run
forty looms</i> and two thousand spindles." "He <i>runs</i> his <i>mill</i>
evenings." Such expressions are common and correct,
because they convey ideas, and are understood.</p>

<p>Two men were engaged in argument. The believer in
intransitive verbs set out to <i>run his opponent</i> into an evident
absurdity, and, contrary to his expectation, he <i>ran himself</i>
into one. Leave out the objects of this verb, run, and the
sense is totally changed. He set out to <i>run</i> into an <i>evident
absurdity</i>, and he ran into one; that is, he did the very absurd
thing which he intended to
do.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>"<i>I walk.</i>"</p>

<p>The action expressed by this verb is very similar in
character to the former, but rather <i>slower</i> in performance.
Writers on health tell us that <i>to walk</i> is a very healthy exercise,
and that it would be well for men of sedentary habits
<i>to walk</i> several miles every day. But if there is no
action in walk, or if it has no <i>object</i> necessarily <i>walked</i>, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
would be difficult to understand what good could result from
it.</p>

<p>"Did you have a pleasant <i>walk</i> this morning?" says a
teacher to his grammar class.</p>

<p>"We did have a very pleasant one. The flowers were
<i>blooming</i> on each side of the <i>walk</i>, and <i>sent</i> forth their
sweetest aroma, <i>perfuming</i> the soft breezes of the morning.
Birds were <i>flitting from</i> spray to spray, <i>carolling</i> their
hymns of praise to Deity. The tranquil waters of the lake
lay <i>slumbering</i> in silence, and <i>reflected</i> the bright <i>rays</i> of
the sun, <i>giving</i> a sweet but solemn <i>aspect</i> to the whole
scene. <i>To go</i> thro the grove, down by the lake, and up
thro the meadow, is the most delightful <i>walk</i> a person can
take."</p>

<p>"How did you get your <i>walk</i>?"</p>

<p>"We walked it, to be sure; how did you think we got
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not know. <i>Walk</i>, your books tell you, is an
intransitive verb, terminating on no object; so I supposed,
if you followed them, you obtained it some other way; by
<i>riding</i>, <i>running</i>, <i>sailing</i>, or, may be, <i>bought</i> it, as you could
not have <i>walked it</i>! Were you tired on your return?"</p>

<p>"We were exceedingly fatigued, for you know it is a
very long <i>walk</i>, and we <i>walked it</i> in an hour."</p>

<p>"But <i>what</i> tired you? If there are no effects produced
by walking, I can not conceive why <i>you</i> should be fatigued
by such exercise."</p>

<p>Who does not perceive what flagrant violations of grammar
rules are committed every day, and every hour, and
in almost every sentence that is framed to express our
knowledge of facts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<i>To step.</i></p>

<p>This verb is the same in character with the two just noticed.
It expresses the act of <i>raising</i> each foot alternately,
and usually implies that the body is, by that means, conveyed
from one place to another. But as people <i>step</i> their
<i>feet</i> and not their hands, or any thing else, it is entirely useless
to mention the object; for generally, that can not be
mistaken any more than in the case of the gloves, boots, and
hat. But it would be bad philosophy to teach children that
there is no objective word after it, because it is not written
out and placed before their eyes. They will find such teaching
contradicted at every <i>step</i> they take. Let a believer in
intransitive verbs <i>step</i> on a red hot iron; he will soon find
to his sorrow, that he was mistaken when he thought that
he could <i>step</i> without stepping any thing. It would be
well for grammar, as well as many other things, to have
more practice and less theory. The thief was detected by
his steps. Step softly; put your feet down carefully.</p>

<p><i>Birds fly.</i></p>

<p>We learned from our primers, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The eagle's <i>flight</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is out of sight,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How did the eagle succeed in producing a <i>flight</i>? I suppose
he <i>flew</i> it. And if birds ever fly, they must produce a flight.
Such being the fact, it is needless to supply the object. But
the action does not terminate solely on the flight produced,
for that is only the name given to the action itself. The
expression conveys to the mind the obvious fact, that, by
strong muscular energy, by the aid of feathers, and the atmosphere,
the bird carries itself thro the air, and changes
its being from one place to another. As birds rarely fly a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
race, or any thing but <i>themselves</i> and a <i>flight</i>, it is not necessary
to suffix the object.</p>

<p><i>It rains.</i></p>

<p>This verb is insisted on as the strongest proof of intransitive
action; with what propriety, we will now inquire. It
will serve as a clear elucidation of the whole theory of intransitive
verbs.</p>

<p>What does the expression signify? It simply declares
the fact, that <i>water is shed</i> down from the clouds. But is
there no object after <i>rains</i>? There is none expressed. Is
there nothing rained? no effect produced? If not, there can
be no water fallen, and our cisterns would be as empty, our
streams as low, and fields as parched, after a rain as before
it! But who that has common sense, and has never been
blinded by the false rules of grammar, does not know that
when <i>it rains</i>, it never fails to <i>rain rain</i>, <i>water</i>, or <i>rain-water</i>,
unless you have one of the paddy's dry rains? When it
hails, it hails <i>hail</i>, <i>hail-stones</i>, or frozen <i>rain</i>. When it
snows, it <i>snows snow</i>, sometimes two feet of it, sometimes
less. I should think teachers in our northern countries
would find it exceeding difficult to convince their readers
that snow is an intransitive verb&mdash;that it snows <i>nothing</i>.
And yet so it is; people will remain wedded to their old
systems, and refuse to open their eyes and behold the evidences
every where around them. Teachers themselves,
the guides of the young&mdash;and I blush to say it, for I was
long among the number&mdash;have, with their scholars, labored
all the morning, breaking roads, <i>shovelling snow</i>, and clearing
paths, to get to the school-house, and then set down and
taught them that <i>to snow</i> is an <i>in</i>transitive verb. What
nonsense; nay, worse, what falsehoods have been instilled
into the youthful mind in the name of grammar! Can we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
be surprised that people have not understood grammar?
that it is a dry, cold, and lifeless business?</p>

<p>I once lectured in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. In a conversation
with Miss B., a distinguished scholar, who had taught
a popular female school for twenty years; was remarking
upon the subject of intransitive verbs, and the apparent inconsistency
of the new system, that all verbs must have an
object after them, expressed or understood; she said, "there
was the verb <i>rain</i>, (it happened to be a rainy day,) the
whole action is confined to the agent; it does not pass on
to another object; it is purely intransitive." Her aged
mother, who had never looked into a grammar book, heard
the conversation, and very bluntly remarked, "Why, you
fool you, I want to know if you have studied grammar these
thirty years, and taught it more than twenty, and have
never <i>larned</i> that when it rains it <i>always</i> rains <i>rain</i>? If it
didn't, do you s'pose you'd need an umbrella to go out now
into the storm? I should think you'd know better. I always
told you these plaguy grammars were good for nothing,
I didn't b'lieve." "Amen," said I, to the good sense
of the old lady, "you are right, and have reason to be
thankful that you have never been initiated into the intricate
windings, nor been perplexed with the false and contradictory
rules, which have blasted many bright geniuses in their
earliest attempts to gain a true knowledge of the sublime
principles of language, on which depends so much of the
happiness of human life." The good matron's remark was
a poser to the daughter, but it served as a means of her
entire deliverance from the thraldom of neuter verbs, and the
adoption of the new principles of the exposition of language.</p>

<p>The anecdote shows us how the unsophisticated mind
will observe facts, and employ words as correctly, if not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
more so, than those schooled in the high pretensions of science,
falsely taught. Who does not know from the commonest
experience, that the direct object of <i>raining</i> must
follow as the necessary sequence? that it can never fail?
And yet our philologists tell us that such is not always the
case; and that the exception is to be marked on the singular
ground, whether the word is written out or omitted!
What a narrow view of the sublime laws of motion! What
a limited knowledge of things! or else, what a <i>mistake</i>!</p>

<p>"Then the Lord said unto Moses, behold, I will <i>rain</i>
bread for you from heaven."</p>

<p>"Then the <i>Lord rained</i> down, upon Sodom and Gomorrah,
<i>brimstone</i> and <i>fire</i>, from the Lord out of heaven."&mdash;<i>Bible.</i></p>

<p><i>The fire burns.</i></p>

<p>The fire <i>burns</i> the wood, the coal, or the peat. The
great fire in New-York <i>burned</i> the buildings which covered
fifty-two acres of ground. Mr. Experiment <i>burns</i> coal in
preference to wood. His new grate <i>burns it</i> very finely.
Red ash coal <i>burns</i> the best; it <i>makes</i> the fewest <i>ashes</i>, and
hence <i>is</i> the most convenient. The cook <i>burns</i> too much
fuel. The house took fire and <i>burned</i> up. <i>Burned what</i>
up? Burn is an intransitive verb. It would not trouble
the unfortunate tenant to know that there must be an <i>object
burned</i>, or what <i>it</i> was. He would find it far more difficult
to rebuild his <i>house</i>. Do you suppose fires never burn any
thing belonging to neuter verb folks? Then they never
need pay away insurance money. With the solitary exception
I have mentioned&mdash;the burning bush&mdash;this verb can
not be intransitive.</p>

<p><i>The sun shines.</i></p>

<p>This is an intransitive verb if there ever was one, because
the object is not often expressed after it. But if the sun
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<i>emits</i> no <i>rays</i> of light, how shall it be known whether it
shines or not? "The <i>radiance</i> of the sun's bright beaming"
is produced by the <i>exhibition</i> of <i>itself</i>, when it <i>brightens</i>
the objects exposed to its <i>rays</i> or <i>radiance</i>. We talk of
<i>sun shine</i> and moon shine, but if these bodies never produce
<i>effects</i> how shall it be known whether such things are real?
<i>Sun shine</i> is the direct effect of the sun's <i>shining</i>. But
clouds sometimes intervene and prevent the rays from extending
to the earth; but <i>then</i> we do not say "the sun <i>shines</i>."
You see at once, that all we know or can know of the fact
we state as truth, is derived from a knowledge of the very
<i>effects</i> which our grammars tell us do not exist. Strange
logic indeed! It is a mark of a wiser man, and a better
scholar, not to know the popular grammars, than it is to
profess any degree of proficiency in them!</p>

<p><i>To smile.</i></p>

<p>The <i>smiles</i> of the morning, the <i>smiles</i> of affection, a <i>smile</i>
of kindness, are only produced by the appearance of something
that <i>smiles</i> upon us. <i>Smiles</i> are the direct consequence
of <i>smiling</i>. If a person should <i>smile</i> ever so <i>sweetly</i>
and yet present no <i>smiles</i>, they might, for aught we could
know to the contrary, be <i>sour</i> as vinegar.</p>

<p>But this verb frequently has another object after it; as,
"to <i>smile</i> the <i>wrinkles</i> from the brow of age," or "<i>smile</i>
dull <i>cares</i> away." "A sensible wife would soon <i>reason</i> and
<i>smile him</i> into good nature."</p>

<p>But I need not multiply examples. When such men as
Johnson, Walker, Webster, Murray, Lowthe, and a host of
other wise and renowned men, gravely tell us that <i>eat</i> and
<i>drink</i>, which they define, "to <i>take food</i>; <i>to feed</i>; <i>to take a
meal</i>; <i>to go to meals</i>; to be maintained in food; <i>to swallow
liquors</i>; <i>to quench thirst</i>; to take any liquid;" are
<i>intrans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>itive</i>
or <i>neuter</i> verbs, having no objects after them, we must
think them insincere, egregiously mistaken, or else possessed
of a means of subsistence different from people generally!
Did they <i>eat</i> and <i>drink</i>, "take food and swallow
liquors," <i>in</i>transitively; that is, without <i>eating</i> or <i>drinking</i>
any thing? Is it possible in the nature of things? Who
does not see the absurdity? And yet they were <i>great</i> men,
and nobody has a right to question such <i>high</i> authority.
And the "<i>simplifiers</i>" who have come after, making books
and teaching grammar to <i>earn</i> their <i>bread</i>, have followed
close in their footsteps, and, I suppose, <i>eaten</i> nothing, and
thrown their bread away! Was I a believer in neuter
verbs and desired to get money, my first step would be to
set up a boarding house for all believers in, and <i>practisers</i>
of, intransitive verbs. I would board cheap and give good
fare. I could afford it, for no provisions would be consumed.</p>

<p>Some over cautious minds, who are always second, if not
last, in a good cause, ask us why these principles, if so true
and clear, were not found out before? Why have not the
learned who have studied for many centuries, never seen
and adopted them? It is a sufficient answer to such a
question, to ask why the copernican system of astronomy
was not sooner adopted, why the principles of chemistry,
the circulation of the blood, the power and application of
steam, nay, why all improvement was not known before.
When grammar and dictionary makers, those wise expounders
of the principles of speech, have so far forgotten
facts as to teach that <i>eat</i> and <i>drink</i>, "express neither action
nor passion," or are "confined to the agents;" that when
a man eats, he eats nothing, or when he drinks, he drinks
nothing, we need not stop long to decide why these things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were unknown before. The wisest may sometimes mistake;
and the proud aspirant for success, frequently passes
over, unobserved, the humble means on which all true success
depends.</p>

<p>Allow me to quote some miscellaneous examples which
will serve to show more clearly the importance of supplying
the elipses, in order to comprehend the meaning of the
writers, or profit by their remarks. You will supply the
objects correctly from the attendant circumstances where
they are not expressed.</p>

<p>"Ask (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and ye shall receive (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); seek (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and ye

you."</p>

<p>Ask <i>what</i>? Seek <i>what</i>? Knock <i>what</i>? That <i>it</i> may
be opened? Our "Grammars Made Easy" would teach
us to <i>ask</i> and <i>seek</i> nothing! no objectives after them.
What then could we reasonably expect to <i>receive</i> or <i>find</i>?
The <i>thing</i> we <i>asked</i> for, of course, and that was nothing!
Well might the language apply to such, "Ye ask (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and
<i>receive not</i> (naught) because ye ask (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) amiss." False
teaching is as pernicious to religion and morals as to science.</p>

<p>What a lie! say you. <i>A lie?</i> I hope you do not accuse
<i>me</i> of lying. If there is any thing false in this matter
it all <i>lies</i> in the quotation, at the conclusion, from the standard
grammar. If that is false, whose fault is it? Not mine,
certainly. But what if I should <i>lie</i> (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), intransitively? I
should tell no falsehoods.</p>

<p>But enough of this. If there is any thing irrational or
inconsistent, any thing false or ridiculous, in this view of the
subject, it should be remembered that it has been long taught,
not only in common schools, but in our academies and colleges,
as serious, practical truth; as the only means of acquiring
a correct knowledge of language, or fitting ourselves
for usefulness or respectability in society. You smile
at such trash, and well you may; but you must bear in
mind that grammar is not the only thing in which we may
turn round and <i>laugh</i> (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) at past follies.</p>

<p>But I am disposed to consider this matter of more serious
consequence than to deserve our <i>laughter</i>. When I see the
rising generation spend months and years of the best and most
important part of their lives, which should be devoted to the
acquisition of that which is true and useful, studying the
dark and false theory of language as usually taught, I am
far from feeling any desire to laugh at the folly which imposes
such a task upon them. I remember too distinctly
the years that have just gone by. I have seen too many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
blighted hopes, too many wearisome hours, too many sad
countenances, too many broken resolutions; to say nothing
of corporeal chastisements; to think it a small matter that
children are erroneously taught the rudiments of language,
because sanctioned by age, or great names. A change, an
important change, a radical change, in this department of
education, is imperiously demanded, and teachers must obey
the call, and effect the change. There is a spirit abroad in
the land which will not bow tamely and without complaint,
to the unwarranted dictation of arbitrary, false, and contradictory
rules, merely from respect to age. It demands
reason, consistency and plainness; and yields assent only
where they are found. And teachers, if they will not lead
in the reformation, must be satisfied to follow after; for a
reformation is loudly called for, and will be had. None are
satisfied with existing grammars, which, in principle, are
nearly alike. The seventy-three attempts to improve and
simplify Murray, have only acted <i>intransitively</i>, and accomplished
very little, if any good, save the employment given
to printers, paper makers, and booksellers.</p>

<p>But I will not enlarge. We have little occasion to wonder
at the errors and mistakes of grammar makers, when
our lexicographers tell us for sober truth, that <span class="smcap">to act</span>, <i>to be
in action</i>, <i>not to rest</i>, to be in <i>motion</i>, to <i>move</i>, is <i>v. n.</i> a verb
neuter, signifying <i>no action</i>!! or <i>v. i.</i> verb intransitive,
producing <i>no effects</i>; and that a "<i>neuter verb</i> <span class="smcap">expresses</span>
(active transitive verb) <i>a state of being</i>!! There are few
minds capable of adopting such premises, and drawing
therefrom conclusions which are rational or consistent.
Truth is rarely elicted from error, beauty from deformity,
or order from confusion. While, therefore, we allow the
neuter systems to sink into forgetfulness, as they usually do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
as soon as we leave school and shut our books, let us throw
the mantle of charity over those who have thoughtlessly
(without <i>thinking thoughts</i>) and innocently lead us many
months in dark and doleful wanderings, in paths of error
and contradiction, mistaken for the road to knowledge and
usefulness. But let us resolve to save ourselves and future
generations from following the same unpleasant and unprofitable
course, and endeavor to <i>reflect</i> the <i>light</i> which may
<i>shine</i> upon our minds, to dispel the surrounding darkness,
and secure the light and knowledge of truth to those who
shall come after us.</p>

<p>Many philologists have undertaken to explain our language
by the aid of foreign tongues. Because there are
genitive cases, different kinds of verbs, six tenses, etc. in
the Latin or Greek, the same distinctions should exist in
our grammars. But this argument will not apply, admitting
that other languages will not allow of the plan of exposition
we have adopted, which we very seriously question,
tho we have not time to go into that investigation. We
believe that the principles we have adopted are capable of
universal application; that what is action in England would
be action in Greece, Rome, Turkey, and every where else;
that "<i>like causes will produce like effects</i>" all the world over.
It matters not by whom the action is seen, it is the same,
and all who gather ideas therefrom will describe it as it appears
to them, let them speak what language they may.
But if they have no ideas to express, they need no language
to speak. Monkeys, for aught I know to the contrary, can
speak as well as we; but the reason they do not, is because
they have nothing to say.</p>

<p>Let Maelzael's automaton chess-player be exhibited to a
promiscuous multitude. They would all attempt a
descrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>tion
of it, so far as they were able to gain a knowledge of
its construction, each in his own language. Some might be
unable to trace the <i>cause</i>, the moving <i>power</i>, thro all the
curiously arranged <i>means</i>, to the <i>agent</i> who acted as prime
mover to the whole affair. Others, less cautious in their
conclusions, might think it a perpetual motion. Such would
find a <i>first cause</i> short of the Creator, the great original
of all things and actions; and thus violate the soundest principles
of philosophy. Heaven has never left a vacuum
where a new and <i>self</i> sustaining power may be set in operation
independent of his ever-present supervision; and
hence the long talked of <i>perpetual motion</i> is the vainest chimera
which ever occupied the human brain. It may well
appear as the opposite extreme of neuter verbs; for, while
one would give no action to matter according to the physical
laws which regulate the world, the other would make matter
act of itself, independent of the Almighty. Be it ours to
take a more rational and consistent stand; to view all things
and beings as occupying a place duly prescribed by Infinite
Wisdom, <i>acting</i> according to their several abilities, and subject
to the regulation of the all-pervading laws which guide,
preserve, and harmonize the whole.</p>

<p>If there is a subject which teaches us beyond controversy
the existence of a Supreme Power, a Universal Father, an
all-wise and ever-present God, it is found in the order and
harmony of all things, produced by the regulation of Divine
laws; and man's superiority to the rest of the world is most
clearly proved, from the possession of a power to adapt
language to the communication of ideas in free and social
converse, or in the transmission of thought, drawn from an
observation and knowledge of things as presented to his
understanding.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
There is no science so directly important to the growth
of intellect and the future happiness of the child, as the
knowledge of language. Without it, what is life? Wherein
would man be elevated above the brute? And what is
language without ideas? A sound without harmony&mdash;a
shadow without a substance.</p>

<p>Let language be taught on the principles of true philosophy,
as a science, instead of an arbitrary, mechanical business,
a mere art, and you will no longer hear the complaint
of a "<i>dry</i>, <i>cold</i>, uninteresting study." Its rules will be
simple, plain, and easy; and at every step the child will
increase in the knowledge of more than <i>words</i>, in an acquaintance
with principles of natural and moral science.
And if there is any thing that will carry the mind of the
child above the low and grovelling things of earth, and fill
the soul with reverence and devotion to the Holy Being
who fills immensity with his presence, it is when, from observing
the laws which govern matter, he passes to observe
the powers and capabilities of the mind, and thence ascends
to the Intellectual Source of <i>light</i>, <i>life</i>, and <i>being</i>, and contemplates
the perennial and ecstatic joys which flow from
the presence of Deity; soul mingling with soul, love absorbed
in love, and God all in all.</p>

conclusion that I have, viz. that all verbs depend on a <i>common
principle</i> for their explanation; that they are alike active,
and necessarily take an object after them, either expressed
or understood, in accordance with the immutable
law of nature, which teaches that like causes will produce
like effects.</p>

<p>The verb <span class="smcap">to be</span>, as it is called, is conjugated by the aid
of six different words, in its various modes and tenses; <i>am</i>,
<i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, <i>be</i>. <i>Am</i> is unchanged, always in the
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>dicative
mood, present tense, agreeing with the <i>first</i> person
singular. <i>Is</i> is also unchanged, in the same mood and
tense, agreeing with the <i>third</i> person singular. <i>Art</i>, in the
singular, is the same as <i>are</i> in the plural. <i>Was</i> and <i>wast</i>,
are the same as <i>were</i> and <i>wert</i> in meaning, being derived
from the same etymon. <i>Be</i>, <i>being</i>, and <i>been</i>, are changes
of the same word. <i>Be</i> was formerly extensively used in
the indicative present, but in that condition it is nearly obsolete.
<i>Were</i> was also used in the singular as well as
plural, especially when coming before the agent; as, "were
I to go, I would do your business." But it is now more
common to have <i>was</i> correctly used in that case. But, as
one extreme often follows another, people have laid <i>were</i>
quite too much aside, and often crowd <i>was</i> into its place in
common conversation; as "we <i>was</i> (were) there yesterday."
"There <i>was</i> (were) five or six men engaged in the business."
This error appears to be gaining ground, and should
be checked before it goes farther.</p>

<p>The combination of these different words was produced
by habit, to avoid the monotony which the frequent recurrence
of one word, so necessary in the expression of thought,
would occasion: the same as the past tense of <i>go</i> is made
by the substitution of another word radically different, <i>went</i>,
the past tense of <i>wend</i> or <i>wind</i>. "O'er hills and dales they
<i>wend</i> their way." "The lowing herd <i>wind</i> slowly o'er the
lea." <i>Go</i> and <i>wend</i> convey to our minds nearly the same
ideas. The latter is a little more poetical, because less
used. But originally their signification was quite different.
So with the parts of the verb <span class="smcap">to be</span>. They were consolidated
as a matter of convenience, and now appear in their
respective positions to express the idea of being, life, or existence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I have said this verb expresses the highest degree of action.
I will now attempt to prove it. I should like to go
into a labored and critical examination of the words, and
trace their changes thro various languages, was it in accordance
with the design of these lectures. But as it is not,
I shall content myself with general observations.</p>

<p><i>I am.</i></p>

<p>This word is not defined in our dictionaries. It is only
said to be "<i>the first person of to be</i>." We must look for its
meaning some where else. It is a compound of two ancient
words, <i>ah</i>, <i>breath</i>, to <i>breathe</i>, life, to <i>live</i>, <i>light</i>, to <i>light</i>; and
<i>ma</i>, the <i>hand</i>, or to <i>hand</i>. It signifies to <i>vivify</i>, <i>sustain</i>, or
<i>support</i> one's self in being or existence. In process of time,
like other things in this mutable world, its form was changed,
but the meaning retained. But as one person could not
<i>vivify</i> or <i>live</i> another, <i>inflate</i> another's lungs, or breathe
another's breath, it became restricted to the first person. It
means, I <i>breathe breath</i>, <i>vivify myself</i>, <i>live life</i>, or <i>exercise</i>
the power of <i>being</i> or <i>living</i>. It conveys this fact in every
instance, for no person incapable of breathing can say <i>I am</i>.
Let any person pronounce the word <i>ah-ma</i>, and they will
at once perceive the appropriateness of the meaning here
given. It is very similar to the letter <i>h</i>, and the pronoun,
(originally <i>noun</i>,) <i>he</i>, or the "<i>rough breathing</i>" in the Greek
language. <i>Ma</i> is compounded with many words which
express action done by the hand; as, <i>ma</i>nufacture, <i>ma</i>numit.
It denoted any action or work done by the hand as
the instrument; but, like other words, it gradually changed
its import, so as to express any <i>effective</i> operation. Hence
the union of the words was natural and easy, and <i>ahma</i> denoted
<i>breathing</i>, <i>to live</i> or sustain life. <i>H</i> is a precarious
letter in all languages that use it, as the pronunciation of it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
by many who speak the English language, will prove. It
was long ago dropt, in this word, and after it the last <i>a</i>, so
that we now have the plain word <i>am</i>.</p>

<p>It was formerly used as a noun in our language, and as
such may be found in Exodus 3: 13, 14. "And Moses
said unto God, Behold when I come unto the children of
Israel and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
<i>name</i>? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto
Moses, I <span class="smcap">am</span> the I AM; and he said, Thus shalt thou say
unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you."
Chap. 6: 3.&mdash;"I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and
unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my
name <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> (I AM) was I not known unto them." The
word <i>Jehovah</i> is the same as <i>am</i>. It is the name of the
<i>self-existent</i>, <i>self-sustaining</i> <span class="smcap">Being</span>, who has not only power
to uphold all things, but to perform the still more sublime
action of <i>upholding</i> or <i>sustaining himself</i>. This is the highest
possible degree of action. Let this fail, and all creation
will be a wreck. He is the <i>ever-living</i>, <i>uncontrolled</i>, <i>unfailing</i>,
<i>unassisted</i>, and <i>never-changing</i> God, the Creator,
Preserver, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and End of
all things. He is the <i>First Cause</i> of all causes, the <i>Agent</i>,
original moving Power, and guiding Wisdom, which set in
motion the wheels of universal nature, and guides and governs
them without "variableness or the shadow of turning."</p>

<p>Ask the Jews the meaning of this <i>neuter verb</i> in their
language. They hold it in the most profound and
supersti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>tious
reverence. After the captivity of their nation they
never dared pronounce the name except once a year when
the high priest went into the Holy of Holies, and hence the
true pronunciation of it was lost. Unto this day they dare
not attempt to utter it. In all their writings it remains in
characters untranslated. When their Messiah comes they
expect he will restore the pronunciation, and by it they
shall be able to accomplish all
things.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>According to Plutarch the Greeks had the letters EI,
<span class="smcap">thou art</span>, engraven on the temple of Apollo at Delphi,
which is the second person of <span class="smcap">Eimi</span>,
<i>I am</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>This motto was doubtless borrowed from the Jews, to
whom it was given as the name of the God of Jacob. The
same name you may see engraven on monuments, on pictures
of the bible, on masonic implements, and in various
places, untranslated.</p>

<p>Who can suppose that this word "expresses no action,"
when the very person incapable of it can not utter it, and no
one else can speak it for him? It denotes the highest conceivable
action applied to Deity or to man, and it is
ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>tionable
philosophy which dares contradict this fact. The
action expressed by it, is not changed, because it does not
terminate on a foreign object. It remains the same. It is
self-action.</p>

<p><i>He is.</i></p>

<p>This word is constructed from an old verb signifying <i>to
stand forth</i>, <i>to appear</i>, <i>to show one's self</i>, and may be traced,
I think, to the latin <i>eo</i>, <i>to go</i>, and <i>exist</i>, to <i>exeo</i>, <i>to go from</i>;
that is, our <i>being</i> or <i>existence</i>, <i>came</i> or <i>stood forth</i> from God.
It is certainly a contraction from the old english <i>to exist</i>.
<i>Ist</i> is the spelling still retained in the german and some
other languages. It denotes self-action. One man does
not <i>exist</i> another, but himself. He <i>keeps himself</i> in existence.</p>

<p><i>We are</i>, <i>thou are-est</i>, <i>arst</i>, or <i>art</i>.</p>

<p>Be not <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'surprized'">surprised</ins>
when I tell you this is the same word as
<i>air</i>, for such is the fact. It signifies to inhale air, to <i>air
ourselves</i>, or <i>breathe air</i>. "God <i>breathed</i> into man the
<i>breath of life</i>, and man became a <i>living soul</i>." The new
born infant <i>inhales air</i>, <i>inflates its lungs</i> with <i>air</i>, and begins
to live. We all know how essential <i>air</i> is to the preservation
of life. No animal can live an instant without it.
Drop a squirrel into a receiver from which all <i>air</i> has been
extracted, and it can not live. Even vegetables will die
where there is no air. <i>Light</i> is also indispensable to <i>life</i> and
<i>health</i>. <i>Air</i> is <i>inhaled</i> and <i>exhaled</i>, and from it life receives
support. The fact being common, it is not so distinctly observed
by the careless, as tho it was more rare. But did
you never see the man dying of a consumption, when the
pulmonary or breathing organs were nearly decayed?
How he labors for breath! He asks to have the windows
thrown open. At length he <i>suffocates</i> and dies. Most
per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>sons
struggle hard for <i>breath</i> in the hour of dissolving nature.
The heaving bosom, the hollow gasp for <i>air</i>, tells
us that the lamp of life is soon to be extinguished, that the
hour of their departure has come.</p>

<p>When a person faints, we carry them into the <i>air</i>, or blow
<i>air</i> upon them, that nature may be restored to its regular
course. In certain cases physicians find it necessary to
force air into the lungs of infants; they can after that <i>air</i>,
themselves, <i>imbibe</i> or <i>drink in air</i>, or <i>inspirit</i> themselves
with air. But I need not enlarge. Whoever has been deprived
of air and labored hard for breath in a stifled or unwholesome
air, can appreciate what we mean.</p>

<p><i>We were</i>; <i>he was</i>.</p>

<p>I have said before that these words are the same, and are
used in certain cases irrespective of number. I have good
authority for this opinion, altho some etymologists give them
different derivations.</p>

<p><i>Were</i>, <i>wert</i>; <i>worth</i>, <i>werth</i>; <i>word</i> and <i>werde</i>, are derived
from the same etymon and retain a similarity of meaning.
They signify <i>spirit</i>, <i>life</i>, <i>energy</i>. "In the beginning was
the <i>word</i>, and the <i>word</i> was with God." "By the <i>word</i> of
his grace."</p>

<p>"<i>They were</i>," they <i>inspirited</i> themselves, <i>possessed</i> the
life, vitality, or <i>spirit</i>, the Creator gave them, and having
that spirit, life, or energy, under proper regulation, in due
degree, they were <i>worthy</i> of the esteem, regard, sympathy,
and good <i>word</i> of others.</p>

<p><i>To be.</i></p>

<p>This is considered the root of all the words we have considered,
and to it all others are referred for a definition.
Dictionaries give no definition to <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, and <i>were</i>,
all of them as truly principal verbs as <i>be</i>, and possessed of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as distinct a meaning. It can hardly be possible that they
should form so important a part of our language, and yet be
incapable of definition. But such is the fact, the most significant
words in our language, and those most frequently
used, are undefined in the books.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster says <span class="smcap">to be</span> signifies, "to exist, to <i>have</i> a
real <i>state</i> or <i>existence</i>," and so say Walker and Johnson.
Now if it is possible to "<span class="smcap">have</span> <i>a state of being</i> without action
or passion," then may this word express neutrality. But
the very definition requires activity, and an object expressed.
It denotes the <i>act of being</i>, or living; to <i>exercise</i> the powers
of life, to <i>maintain</i> a position or rank in the scale of existent
things.</p>

<p>The name of the action is <i>being</i>, and applies to the Almighty
BEING who <i>exists</i> unchanged as the source of all
inferior <i>beings</i> and things, whose name is <i>Jehovah</i>, I AM,
the Being of beings, the Fountain of <i>light</i>, <i>life</i>, and <i>wisdom</i>.</p>

<p><i>Be</i> is used in the imperative and infinitive moods correctly,
by every body who employs language. "<i>Be</i> here in
ten minutes." "<i>Be it</i> far from thee." "I will <i>be</i> in Boston
before noon." If there is any action in going from Providence
to Boston at rail-road speed, in two hours, or before
noon, it is all expressed by the verb <i>be</i>, which we are told
expresses <i>no action</i>.</p>

<p>The teacher says to his scholars when out at play, "I
want you <i>to be</i> in your seats in five minutes." What would
they understand him to mean? that they should stand still?
or that they should <i>change their state of being</i> from play in
the yard, to a state of being in their seats? There is no
word to denote such change, except the word <i>to be</i>. <i>Be</i> off,
<i>be</i> gone, <i>be</i> here, <i>be</i> there, are commands frequently given
and correctly understood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
The master says to a bright little lad, who has well
learned his grammar, "<i>Be</i> here in a minute."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will <i>be</i> there;" but he does not move.</p>

<p>"<i>Be</i> here immediately."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will <i>be</i> there."</p>

<p>"Don't you understand me? I say, <i>be</i> here instantly."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I understand you and will obey."</p>

<p>The good man is enraged. "You scoundrel," says he,
"do you mean to disobey my orders and insult me?"</p>

<p>"Insult you and disobey you; I have done neither," replies
the honest boy.</p>

<p>"Yes you have, and I will chastise you severely for it."</p>

<p>"No, master, I have not; I declare, I have not. I have
obeyed you as well as I know how, to the very letter and
spirit of your command."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you <i>to be</i> here in a minute, and have not
you <i>remained</i> where you were? and didn't you say you
would <i>be</i> here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and did not I do just what you told me to?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, you blockhead; I told you <i>to be</i> here."</p>

<p>"Well, I told you I would <i>be</i> there."</p>

<p>"You <i>was</i> not here."</p>

<p>"Nor did you expect I would <i>be</i>, if you have taught me
to <i>speak</i>, <i>write</i>, and understand correctly."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you saucy boy?"</p>

<p>"I mean to mind my master, and do what he tells me to."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do so then?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You didn't."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You lie, you insult me, you contradict me, you saucy
fellow. You are not fit to be in school. I will punish you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
severely." And in a passion he starts for his ferrule, takes
the boys hand, and bruises him badly; the honest little
fellow all the while pleading innocence of any intended
wrong.</p>

<p>In a short time they commence <i>parsing</i> this sentence:
"It is necessary <i>to be</i> very particular in ascertaining the
meaning of words before we use them." The master puts
<i>to be</i> to the same boy. He says it is an <i>active verb</i>, infinitive
mood.</p>

<p>"How is that? an <i>active</i> verb?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"No, it is not. It is a <i>neuter</i> verb."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, master, it is not. It is active."</p>

<p>"Have I got to punish you again so soon, you impudent
fellow. You are not fit to be in school. I will inform
your parents of your conduct."</p>

<p>"What have I done that is wrong?"</p>

<p>"You say <i>to be</i> is an <i>active</i> verb, when <i>I</i> tell you, and
the <i>grammar</i> and <i>dictionary</i> tell you, it is <i>neuter</i>!"</p>

<p>"What is a <i>neuter</i> verb, master?"</p>

<p>"It expresses 'neither action nor passion, but being or a
state of being.' Have you forgotten it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I <i>thought</i> that was the case."</p>

<p>"What did you ask me for then?"</p>

<p>"Because I supposed you had found another meaning for
it."</p>

<p>"To what do you allude, you troublesome fellow, you?
I'll not bear your insults much longer."</p>

<p>"For what did you punish me so severely just now?"</p>

<p>"For disobeying my orders."</p>

<p>"What did you order me to do?"</p>

<p>"<i>To be</i> here in a minute."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
"Well, did not I do what you told me?"</p>

<p>"No; you kept your seat, and did not come near me."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought and did just what you now tell me; that
<i>to be</i> is a <i>neuter</i> verb, expressing no <i>action</i>, but <i>being</i>. I
had a <i>state</i> of <i>being</i>, and promised to keep it, and did keep
it, and you punished me for doing the very thing you told
me to do!!"</p>

<p>The master looked down, shut up his book, and began to
say that grammar is a "<i>dry</i>, <i>cold</i>, and <i>useless</i>" study, hardly
worth the trouble of learning it.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>"<i>I am</i> Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,
saith the Lord, who <i>is</i>, and who <i>was</i>, and who <i>is</i> to come,
the Almighty."&mdash;<i>Rev. 1: 8.</i></p>

<p>If there is any action in maintaining eternal existence, by
which all things were created and are upheld, it is expressed
in the verbs <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, and <i>was</i>.</p>

<p>God said, "Let there <i>be</i> light, and there <i>was</i> light;" or
more properly rendered, "Light <span class="smcap">be</span>, and light <span class="smcap">was</span>."</p>

<p>Was there no action in setting the sun, moon and stars in
the firmament, and in causing them to <i>send</i> forth the rays
of light to <i>dispel</i> the surrounding darkness? If there was,
<i>be</i> and <i>was</i> denote that action.</p>

<p>"You are commanded <span class="smcap">to be</span> and <i>appear</i> before the court
of common pleas," etc. A heavy penalty is imposed upon
those who fail to comply with this citation&mdash;for neglecting
to do what is expressed by the <i>neuter verb</i> to <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>Such cases might be multiplied without number, where
this verb is correctly used by all who employ language,
and correctly understood by all who are capable of knowing
the meaning of words. But I think you must all be
convinced of the truth of our proposition, that all verbs
ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>press
action, either <i>real</i> or <i>relative</i>; and in all cases have
an object, expressed or necessarily implied, which stands as
the <i>effect</i>, and an agent, as the cause of action: and hence
that language, as a means for the communication of thought,
does not deviate from the soundest principles of philosophy,
but in all cases, rightly explained, serves to illustrate them,
in the plainest manner.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>A few remarks on the "Passive Verb," and I will conclude
this part of our subject, which has already occupied
much more of our attention than I expected at the outset.</p>

<p>"<i>A verb passive</i> expresses a passion or a suffering, or
the receiving of an action; and necessarily implies an object
acted upon, and an agent by which it is acted upon;
as, to be loved; Penelope is loved by me."</p>

<p>In the explanation of this verb, grammarians further tell
us that a passive verb is formed by adding the verb <i>to be</i>,
which is thus made auxiliary, to a past participle; as, Portia
<i>was loved</i>. Pompey <i>was conquered</i>.</p>

<p>It is singular how forgetful our great men sometimes are
about observing their own rules. Take an instance in Mr.
Walker's octavo dictionary. Look for the word <i>simeter</i>, a
small sword. You will find it spelled <i>scimitar</i>. Then turn
over, and you will find it <i>s</i>im<i>i</i>t<i>a</i>r, with the same definition,
and the remark, "more properly <i>c</i>im<i>e</i>t<i>a</i>r." Then turn
back, and find the correct word as he spells it, and there
you will find it cimet<i>e</i>r.</p>

<p>Unsettled as to the true spelling, go to our own honored
Webster. Look for "scimiter." He says, see cimit<i>a</i>r.
Then look for "cimitar;" see cim<i>e</i>t<i>e</i>r. Then hunt up the
true word, be it <i>ar</i> or <i>er</i>, and you will find it still another
way, cim<i>i</i>t<i>e</i>r. Here the scholar has seven different ways
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to spell this word, and neither of his authorities have followed
their own examples. I cite this as one of a thousand
instances, where our savans have laid down rules for others,
and disregarded them themselves.</p>

<p>Portia <i>is loved</i> and <i>happy</i>. She is <i>respectable</i>, <i>virtuous</i>,
<i>talented</i>, and <i>respected</i> by all who know her. She <i>is seated
by the door</i>. Does the <i>door</i> seat her? What agent, then,
causes her <i>passion</i> or <i>suffering</i>?</p>

<p>The book is printed. Will you parse <i>is printed</i>? It is
a passive verb, indicative mood, <i>present tense</i>. Who <i>is</i>
printing it? causing it, in the present tense, to <i>suffer</i> or <i>receive</i>
the action? The act of printing <i>was performed</i> a
hundred years ago. How can it be present time?</p>

<p>Penelope <i>is loved</i> by me. The blow <i>is received</i> by me.
It <i>is given</i> by me. Penelope <i>is seated</i> by me. The earthquake
<i>is felt</i> by her. The evils <i>are suffered</i> by her. The
thunder <i>is heard</i> by her. Does this mean that she is the
agent, and the earthquake, evils, and thunder, are the objects
which receive the <i>effects</i> which she produces? That
would be singular philosophy, indeed. But <i>to feel</i>, <i>to suffer</i>,
and <i>to hear</i>, are active, and are constructed into passive
verbs. Why is it not as correct to say she <i>is suffering</i> by
another's wrongs, <i>is raging</i> by the operation of passion, or
<i>is travelling</i> by rail-road, are passive verbs? The fact is,
our language can not <i>be explained</i> by set rules or forms of
speech. We must regard the sense. The past participle,
as it is called, becomes an adjective by use, and describes
her as some way affected by a previous action. She is
<i>learned</i>, <i>handsome</i>, <i>modest</i>, and, of course, <i>beloved</i> by all
who know her.</p>

<p>To say "she <i>is placed</i> by the water's edge," is a passive
verb, and that the water's edge, as the agent, causes her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
"passion, suffering, or receiving of the action," is false and
ridiculous, for she <i>placed</i> herself there.</p>

<p>"We <i>are seated</i> on our seats by the stove." What power
is <i>now</i> operating on us to make us suffer or receive the
action of being seated on our seats? Does the stove perform
this action? This is a passive verb, <i>present tense</i>,
which requires an "object acted upon, and an <i>agent</i> by
which it is acted upon." But we came in and <i>seated ourselves</i>
here an hour ago.</p>

<p>The man <i>is acquitted</i>. He <i>stands acquitted</i> before the
public. He <i>is learned</i>, wise, and happy, very much <i>improved</i>
within a few years. He <i>is</i> always active, studious,
and <i>engaged</i> in his own affairs. He <i>is renowned</i>, and <i>valorous</i>.
She <i>is respected</i>. She <i>lives respected</i>.</p>

<p>If there is such a thing as a passive verb, it can never
be used in the present tense, for the action expressed by the
principal verb which is produced by the agent operating
upon the object, is always <i>past</i> tense, and the auxiliary, or
helping verb <i>to be</i>, is always present. Let this verb be analyzed,
and the true meaning of each word understood, little
difficulty will be found in giving it an explanation.</p>

<p>I will not spend more time in exposing the futility of this
attempted distinction. It depends solely on a verbal form,
but can never <i>be explained</i> so as <i>to be understood</i> by any
scholar. Most grammarians have seen the fallacy of attempting
to give the meaning of this verb. They can show
its <i>form</i>, but <i>are</i> frequently <i>compelled</i>, as in the cases
above, to sort out the "<i>passed</i> participles" from a host of
adjectives, and it will <i>be found</i> exceeding troublesome to
make scholars perceive any difference in the use of the
words, or in the construction of a sentence. But it may be
they have never thought that duty belonged to them; that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
they have nothing to do but to show them what the book
says. Suppose they should teach arithmetic on the same
principles, and learn the scholars to set down 144 as the
product of 12 times 12. Let them look at the form of the
figures, observe just how they appear, and make some more
like them, and thus go thro the book. What would the
child know of arithmetic? Just as much as they do of
grammar, and no more. They would understand nothing
of the science of numbers, of proportion, or addition. They
would exercise the power of imitation, and make one figure
look like another. Beyond that, all would be a <i>terra incognita</i>,
a land unknown. So in the science of language;
children may learn that the verb <i>to be</i>, joined with the past
participle of an active verb, makes <i>a passive verb</i>; but
what that passive verb is when made, or how to apply it,
especially in the present tense, they have no means of
knowing. Their knowledge is all taken on trust, and when
thrown upon their own resources, they have none on which
to rely.</p>

<p>We are now come to consider the different relations of
action in reference to <i>manner</i> and <i>time</i>. We shall endeavor
to be as brief as possible upon this subject, keeping in view
meanwhile that candor and perspicuity which are indispensable
in all our attempts to explain new views.</p>

<p><i>Mood</i> signifies <i>manner</i>. Applied to verbs it explains
<i>how</i>, in <i>what manner</i>, by what means, under what circumstances,
actions are performed.</p>

<p>There are <i>three</i> moods, the <i>indicative</i> or declarative, the
<i>imperative</i> or commanding, and the <i>infinitive</i> or unlimited.</p>

<p>The indicative mood declares an action to be <i>done</i> or <i>doing</i>,
<i>not done</i>, or <i>not doing</i>. It is always in the past or
present tense; as, David <i>killed</i> Goliath; scholars <i>learn</i>
knowledge; I <i>spoke not</i> a word; they <i>sing not</i>.</p>

<p>The imperative mood denotes a command given from the
first <i>person</i> to the <i>second</i>, <i>to do</i> or <i>not do</i> an action. It expresses
the wish or desire of the first person to have a certain
action performed which depends on the agency of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
second. The command is <i>present</i>, but the action signified
by the word is <i>future</i> to the giving of the command. The
second person cannot comply with the will of the first till
such will is made known; as, bring me a book; go to the
door.</p>

<p>The <i>infinitive</i> mood has no direct personal agent, but
is produced as a necessary consequence, growing out of a
certain condition of things. It is always <i>future</i> to such
condition; that is, some prior arrangement must be had
before such consequences will follow. It is always <i>future</i>;
as, they are collecting a force <i>to besiege</i> the city. We
study grammar <i>to acquire</i> a knowledge of language. Windows
are made <i>to admit</i> light. The act of besieging the
city depends on the previous circumstance, the collection of
a force <i>to do</i> it. Were there no windows, the light would
not be admitted to the room.</p>

<p>These distinctions in regard to action must be obvious to
every hearer. You all are aware of the fact that action
necessarily implies an actor, as every effect must have an
efficient cause; and such action clearly or distinctly <i>indicated</i>,
must have such an agent to produce it. 2d. You
are acquainted with the fact that one person can express
his will to the second, directing him to do or avoid some
thing. 3d. From an established condition of things, it is
easy to deduce a consequence which will follow, in the nature
of things, as an unavoidable result of such a combination
of power, cause, and means.</p>

<p>With these principles you are all familiar, whether you
have studied grammar or not. They are clearly marked,
abundantly simple, and must be obvious to all. They form
the only necessary, because the only real, distinction, in the
formation and use of the verb to express action. Any
mi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>nor
distinctions are only calculated to perplex and embarrass
the learner.</p>

<p>But some grammarians have passed these natural barriers,
and built to themselves schemes to accord with their own
vain fancies. The remarks of Mr. Murray upon this point
are very appropos. He says:</p>

<p>"Some writers have given our moods a much greater
extent than we have assigned to them. They assert that
the english language may be said, without any great impropriety,
to have as many moods as it has auxiliary verbs;
and they allege, in support of their opinion, that the compound
expression which they help to form, point out those
various dispositions and actions, which, in other languages,
are expressed by moods. This would be to multiply the
moods without advantage. It is, however, certain, that the
conjugation or variation of verbs, in the english language,
is effected, almost entirely, by the means of auxiliaries.
We must, therefore, accommodate ourselves to this circumstance;
and do that by their assistance, which has been
done in the learned languages (a few instances to the contrary
excepted) in another manner, namely, by varying the
form of the verb itself. At the same time, it is necessary
to set proper bounds to this business, so as not to occasion
obscurity and perplexity, when we mean to be simple and
perspicuous. Instead, therefore, of making a separate mood
for every auxiliary verb, and introducing moods <i>interrogative</i>,
<i>optative</i>, <i>promissive</i>, <i>hortative</i>, <i>precative</i>, &amp;c., we have
exhibited such only as are obviously distinct; and which,
whilst they are calculated to unfold and display the subject
intelligibly to the learner, seem to be sufficient, and not
more than sufficient, to answer all the purposes for which
moods were introduced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
"From grammarians who form their ideas, and make
their decisions, respecting this part of english grammar, on
the principles and constructions of languages which, in these
points, do not suit the peculiar nature of our own, but differ
considerably from it, we may naturally expect grammatical
schemes that are not very perspicuous nor perfectly consistent,
and which will tend more to perplex than to inform
the learner."</p>

<p>Had he followed this rule, he would have saved weeks
and months to every student in grammar in the community.
But his remarks were aimed at Mr. Harris, who was by far
the most popular writer on language in England at that time.
He has adopted the very rules of Mr. Murray, and carried
them out. By a careful observance of the different forms
and changes of the verb and its auxiliaries, he makes out
quite evidently to his own mind, <i>fourteen</i> moods, which I
forbear to name.</p>

<p>Most grammarians contend for <i>five</i> moods, two of which,
the <i>potential</i> or powerful, and the <i>subjunctive</i>, are predicated
on the same principles as Mr. Harris' optative, interrogative,
etc., which they condemn. It is impossible to explain
the character of these moods so as to be understood.
<i>If</i>, it is said, is the sign of the subjunctive, and <i>may</i> and <i>can</i>
of the potential; and yet they are often found together; as,
"I will go <i>if I can</i>." No scholar can determine in what
mood to put this last verb. It of right belongs to both the
potential and subjunctive. <i>If</i> I <i>may</i> be allowed to speak
my mind, I <i>should</i> say that such distinctions were false.</p>

<p>I will not go into an exposure of these useless and false
distinctions, which are adopted to help carry out erroneous
principles. The only pretence for a subjunctive mood is
founded on the fact that <i>be</i> and <i>were</i> were formerly used in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
a character different from what they are at present. <i>Be</i>
was used in the indicative mood, present tense, when doubt
or supposition was implied; as, If I <i>be</i> there; if they <i>be</i>
wise. <i>Be</i> I a man, and <i>receive</i> such treatment? <i>Were</i>
was also used instead of <i>was</i> in the past tense; as, "<i>Were</i>
I an American I would fight for liberty. If I <i>were</i> to admit
the fact." In this character these words are rapidly
becoming obsolete. We now say, "If I <i>am</i> there; am I
a man, and <i>receive</i> such abuses? <i>was</i> I an American; if I
was to admit," etc.</p>

<p>All the round about, perplexing, and tedious affair of
conjugating verbs thro the different modes and tenses will
appear in its true character, when we come to give you a
few brief examples, according to truth and plain sense.
But before doing that it will be necessary to make some remarks
on time.</p>

<p><i>Tense</i> means <i>time</i>. We distinguish time according to
certain events which are generally observed. In the use
of the verb we express action in reference to periods of
time when it is performed.</p>

<p>There are three tenses, or divisions of time; <i>past</i>, <i>present</i>,
and <i>future</i>.</p>

<p><i>Past tense</i> applies to actions which are accomplished;
as, I <i>wrote</i> a book; he <i>recited</i> his lesson.</p>

<p><i>Present tense</i> denotes actions commenced, but not finished,
and now in operation; as, he <i>reads</i> his book; we <i>sit</i>
on our seats and <i>hear</i> the lecture.</p>

<p><i>Future tense</i> refers to actions, which are <i>to take</i> place
hereafter; as, I am <i>to go</i> from the Institute; we desire <i>to
learn</i> grammar correctly.</p>

<p>Every body can mark three plain distinctions of time,
past, present, and future. With the past we have been
ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>quainted.
It has ceased to be. Its works are ended. The
present is a mere line&mdash;, nothing as it were&mdash;which is constantly
passing unchecked from the past to the future. It
is a mere division of the past and future. The Hebrew,
which is strictly a philosophic language, admits no present;
only a <i>past</i> and <i>future</i>. We speak of the present as denoting
an action begun and not finished. In the summer,
we say the trees grow, and bear fruit. But when the fruit
is fallen, and the leaves seared by the frost, we change the
expression, and say, it <i>grew</i> and <i>bore</i> fruit.</p>

<p>Of the <i>future</i> we can know nothing definitely. Heaven
has hung before all human eyes an impenetrable veil which
obscures all future events. No man without prophetic vision
bestowed by Him who "sees the end from the beginning,"
can know what is <i>to be</i>, and no expression can be
made, no words employed which will positively declare a
future action. We may see a present condition of things,
and from it argue what is <i>to be</i>, or take place hereafter;
but all that knowledge is drawn from the past and deduced
from a review of the present relation and tendencies of
things.</p>

<p>I hold the paper near the fire and you say it <i>will</i> burn,
and you say truly, for it has a <i>will</i>, or what is the same, an
inherent tendency <i>to burn</i>. It is made of combustible matter,
like paper which we have seen burn, and hence we argue
this has the same tendency to be consumed. But how
does your mind arrive at that fact? If you had never seen
a substance like it burn, why should you conclude this <i>will</i>?
Does the child know it <i>will</i> burn? No; for it has not yet
learned the quality of the paper. It is not till the child has
been burned that it dreads the fire. Suppose I take some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
asbestus, of the kind called amianthus, which is a mineral,
and is formed of slender flexible fibres like flax; and in
eastern countries, especially in Savoy and Corsica, is manufactured
into cloth, paper, and lamp wicks. It was used
in making winding sheets for the dead, in which the bodies
were burned, and the ashes, retained in the incombustible
sheet, were gathered into an urn, and revered as the manes
of the dead. Suppose I take some of this incombustible
paper or cloth, and present to you. You say it <i>will</i> burn.
Why do you say thus? Because you have seen other materials
which appear like this, consume to ashes. Let us
put it into the fire. It <i>will not</i> burn. It has no <i>tendency</i>
to burn; no quality which will consume. But this is a new
idea to you and hence your mistake. You did not know
it <i>would</i> burn, nor could you <i>indicate</i> such a fact. You only
told your opinion derived from the present appearance of
things, and hence you made an assertion in the <i>indicative</i>
mood, present tense, and added to it an <i>infinitive</i> mood, in
order to deduce the consequence of this future action&mdash;it
<i>wills</i>, or has a <i>tendency</i> to burn. But you were mistaken,
because ignorant of the <i>nature</i> of things. This amianthus
looks like flax, and to a person unacquainted with it, appears
to be as truly combustible; but the mineralogist, and
all who know its properties, know very well that it <i>will</i> not&mdash;wills
nothing, has no inclination, or tendency, to burn.</p>

<p>Take another example. Here is a steel needle. I hold
it before you. You say, "if I let go of it, it <i>will</i> fall," and
you say correctly, for it has such a tendency. But suppose
a magnet, as great as that which is said to have drawn the
iron coffin of Mohammed to the roof of the temple at Mecca,
should be placed in the room above us. The needle,
instead of falling to the floor, would be drawn in the nearest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
direction to that magnet. The <i>will</i> or <i>tendency</i> of the
needle, as generally understood, would be overcome, the
natural law of gravitation would lose its influence, by the
counteracting power of the loadstone.</p>

<p>I say, "I will go home in an hour." But does that expression
<i>indicate</i> the act of <i>going</i>? It is placed in the indicative
mood in our grammars; and <i>go</i> is the principal, and
<i>will</i> the auxiliary verb. May be I shall fall and die before
I reach my home. But the expression is correct; <i>will</i> is
<i>present</i>, go <i>future</i>. I <i>will</i>, I now <i>resolve</i>, am now inclined
<i>to go</i> home.</p>

<p>You see the correctness of our position, that we can not
positively assert a future active in the indicative mood.
Try and form to yourselves a phrase by which it can be
done. Should you succeed, you would violate a law of nature.
You would penetrate the dark curtain of the future,
and claim to yourself what you do not possess, a power to
declare future actions. Prophets, by the help of the Almighty,
had this power conferred upon them. But in the
revelation of the sublime truths they were instructed to
make known, they were compelled to adopt human language,
and make it agree with our manner of speech.</p>

<p>The only method by which we express a future event, is
to make an assertion in the indicative mood, present tense,
and to that append the natural consequence in the infinitive
or unlimited; as, I <i>am to go</i> to Boston. He is preparing <i>to
visit</i> New-York. The infinitive mood is always future to
the circumstance on which it depends.</p>

<p>Mr. Murray says, that "tense, being the distinction of
time, might seem to admit of only the present, past, and future;
but to mark it more <i>accurately</i>, it is made to consist
of six variations, viz.: the present, imperfect, perfect,
plu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>perfect,
first and second future tenses." This <i>more accurate
mark</i>, only serves to expose the author's folly, and distract
the learner's mind. Before, all was plain. The past, present,
and future are distinct, natural divisions, easily understood
by all. But what idea can a person form of an <i>imperfect</i>
tense in action. If there was ever such an action in
the world, it was when <i>grammarians</i> <span class="smcap">made</span> their grammars,
which is, if I mistake not, according to their own authority,
in the <i>im-perfect</i> tense! I <i>wrote</i> a letter. He <i>read</i> his
piece well. The scholar learn<i>ed</i> and recit<i>ed</i> his lesson
<i>perfectly</i>; and yet <i>learned</i>, tho made <i>perfect</i> by
the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'qualifification'">qualification</ins>
of an <i>adverb</i>, is an <i>imperfect</i> action!</p>

<p>But this explains the whole mystery in the business of
grammar. We can here discover the cause of all the
troubles and difficulties we have encountered in the whole
affair. When authors <i>made</i> their books, they <i>did</i> it <i>imperfectly</i>;
when teachers <i>taught</i> them, it was <i>imperfectly</i>; and
when scholars <i>learned</i> them, it was <i>imperfectly</i>!! So at
last, we have found the origin of this whole difficulty, in the
grammars themselves; it was all imperfectly done.</p>

<p>But here, again, <i>mirabile dictu!</i> wonderful to tell, we are
presented with a <i>plu-perfect</i> tense; that is,&mdash;<i>plus</i> means
<i>more</i>,&mdash;a <i>more</i> than perfect tense! What must that be? If
a thing is perfect, we can not easily conceive any thing beyond.
That is a <i>ne plus ultra</i> to all advancement&mdash;there
can be no more beyond. If any change is introduced, it
must be by falling from <i>perfect</i> back to <i>imperfect</i>.</p>

<p>I <i>have said</i>, "many of the distinctions in the grammar
books <i>have proved</i> mischievous; that they are as false as
frivolous;" and this is said <i>perfectly</i>, in the perfect tense.
If I should say, "they <i>had been</i> of some benefit," that would
be <i>more</i> than <i>perfect</i>&mdash;plu-perfect. But when I say, "they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<i>exhibited</i> great depth of research, and <i>conveyed</i> some light
on the subject of which they <i>treated</i>," it would all be <i>im</i>-perfect.</p>

<p>Next, we are presented with a <i>second future</i> tense, which
attempts a division of time unbounded and unknown. In
the greek, they have what is called a "<i>paulo post future</i>,"
which in plain english, means a "<i>little after the future</i>;"
that is, I suppose, when futurity has come to an end, this
tense will commence! At that time we may expect to
meet a "<i>pr&aelig;ter plus quam perfectum</i>"&mdash;a more than perfect
tense! But till that period shall arrive, we see little need
of making such false and unphilosophic distinctions.</p>

<p>A teacher once told me that he explained the distinctions
of time to his scholars from the clock dial which stood in
the school room. Suppose <i>twelve</i> o'clock represents the
<i>present</i> tense; <i>nine</i> would signify the <i>perfect</i>; any thing
between nine and twelve would be <i>imperfect</i>; any thing
beyond, <i>pluperfect</i>. On the other hand, any act, forward of
twelve, would be <i>future</i>; and at <i>three</i> the <i>second future</i>
would commence. I remarked that I thought this a wonderful
improvement, especially to those who were able to
have clocks by which to teach grammar, but that I could
not discover why he did not have <i>three future</i>, as well as
<i>three past</i> tenses. Why, he said, there were no such tenses
marked in the books, and hence there was no occasion to
explain them. I asked him why he did not have a tense
for every hour, and so he could distinguish with Mr. Webster,
<i>twelve</i> tenses, without any trouble whatever; and, by
going three times round the dial, he could easily prove the
correctness of Dr. Beattie's division; for he says, in his
grammar, there are <i>thirty-six</i> tenses, and thinks there can
not be less without "introducing confusion in the
grammat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>ical
<i>art</i>." But he thought such a course would serve rather
to perplex than enlighten; and so thought I. But he was
the teacher of a popular school in the city of &mdash;&mdash;, and
had published a duodecimo grammar of over 300 pages,
entitled "Murray's Grammar, <i>improved</i>, by &mdash;&mdash;." I
will not give his name; it would be libellous!</p>

<p>Mr. Murray thinks because certain things which he asserts,
but does not prove, are found in greek and latin, "we
may doubtless apply them to the english verb; and extend
the principle <i>as far as convenience</i>, and the idiom of our
language require." He found it to his "convenience" to
note <i>six</i> principal, and as many <i>indefinite</i> tenses. Mr. Webster
does the same. Dr. Beattie found it "convenient" to
have <i>thirty-six</i>. In the greek they have <i>nine</i>. Mr. Bauzee
distinguishes in the french <i>twenty</i> tenses; and the royal
academy of Spain present a very learned and elaborate
treatise on <i>seven future tenses</i> in that language. The clock
dial of my friend would be found quite "<i>convenient</i>" in aiding
the "convenience" of such distinctions.</p>

<p>The fact is, there are only three real divisions of time in
any language, because there are only three in nature, and
the ideas of all nations must agree in this respect. In framing
language it was found impossible to mark any other
distinctions, without introducing other words than those which
express simple action. These words became compounded
in process of time, till they are now used as changes of the
same verb. I would here enter into an examination of the
formation of the tenses of greek, latin, french, spanish, and
german verbs, did I conceive it necessary, and show you
how, by compounding two words, they form the various
tenses found in the grammars. But it will be more edifying
to you to confine my remarks to our own language.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Here it will be found impossible to distinguish more than
three tenses, or find the verb in any different form, except
by the aid of other words, wholly foreign from those that
express the action under consideration.</p>

<p>It is by the aid of auxiliary verbs that the perfect, pluperfect,
or future tenses are formed. But when it is shown
you that these are principal verbs, and like many other
words, are used before the infinitive mood without the word
<i>to</i> prefixed to them, you will perceive the consistency of
the plan we propose. That such is the fact we have abundant
evidence to show, and with your consent we will introduce
it in this place. I repeat, all the words long considered
auxiliaries, are <i>principal</i> verbs, declarative of positive
action, and as such are in extensive use in our language.
We can hardly agree that the words <i>will</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>must</i>,
<i>can</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, etc. have no meaning, as our
grammars and dictionaries would teach us; for you may
look in vain for a definition of them, as principal verbs,
with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>The reason these words are not found in the same relation
to other words, with a <i>to</i> after them, is because they
are so often used that we are accustomed to drop that word.
The same may be said of all small words in frequent use;
as, <i>bid</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>dare</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>hear</i>,
<i>have</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>see</i>, and sometimes
<i>needs</i>, <i>tell</i>, and a few others. Bid him go. I <i>dare
say</i> so. I <i>feel</i> it <i>move</i>. We <i>hear</i> him <i>sing</i>. <i>Let</i> us <i>go</i>.
<i>Make</i> him <i>do</i> it. He <i>must go</i> thro Samaria. <i>Tell</i> him <i>do</i>
it immediately.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact, but in keeping with neuter verb systems,
that all the <i>neuter</i> verbs as well as the active, take
these auxiliary or <i>helping</i> verbs, which, according to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
showing <i>help them do nothing</i>&mdash;"express neither
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'actionn'">action</ins> or
passion." A wonderful <i>help</i> indeed!</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> This verb signifies to <i>wish</i>, to <i>resolve</i>, to <i>exercise
volition</i>, in reference to a certain thing or action. "I will
go." I <i>now resolve</i> to perform the act of going. When
applied to inanimate things incapable of volition, it signifies
what is analogous to it, <i>inherent tendency</i>; as, paper <i>will</i>
burn; iron <i>will</i> sink; water <i>will</i> run. All these things
have an inherent or active tendency to change. Water is
composed of minute particles of a round form, piled together.
While on a level they do not move; but let a descent
be made, and these particles, under the influence of gravitation,
<i>will</i> change position, and roll one over another with
a rapidity equalled to the condition in which they are
placed. The same may be observed in a quantity of shot
opened at one side which <i>will</i> run thro the aperture; but
the particles being larger, they will not find a level like
water. Grain, sand, and any thing composed of small particles,
<i>will</i> exhibit the same tendency. Iron, lead, or any
mineral, in a state of igneous solution, <i>will</i> run, has the
same <i>inclination</i> to run as water, or any other liquid. In
oil, tallow, and lard, when expanded by heat, the same tendency
is observed; but severely chilled with the cold, it congeals,
and <i>will</i> not, has no such <i>tendency</i>, to run.</p>

<p>You have doubtless observed a cask filled with water
and nearly tight, (if it is possible, make it quite so,) and
when an aperture is made in the side, it <i>will</i> run but a trifle
before it will stop. Open a vent upon the top of the cask
and it <i>will</i> run freely. This <i>will</i> or tendency was counteracted
by other means which I will not stop here to explain.</p>

<p>This is a most important word in science, physical and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
moral, and may be traced thro various languages where it
exerts the same influence in the expression of thought.</p>

<p>"To avoid multiplying of words, I would crave leave
here, under the word <i>action</i>, to comprehend the <i>forbearance</i>
too of any action proposed; <i>sitting still</i>, or <i>holding one's
peace</i>, when <i>walking</i> or <i>speaking</i> are proposed, tho mere
forbearances, requiring as much the determination of the
<i>will</i>, and being as often weighty in their consequences as
the <i>contrary actions</i>, may, on that consideration, well enough
pass for actions too. For he that shall turn his thoughts
inwards upon what passes in his mind when he <i>wills</i>, shall
see that the <i>will</i> or power of volition is conversant about
nothing."&mdash;<i>Locke's Essay</i>, b. II. c. 21. &sect;&nbsp;30.</p>

<p>It is correctly applied by writers to <i>matter</i> as well as
mind, as may be seen by consulting their works.</p>

<p>The <i>lupulis</i>, or common hop, <i>feels</i> for some elevated object
which will assist it in its high aspirations, and <i>will</i>
climb it by winding from left to right, and <i>will</i> not be
obliged to go in an opposite direction; while the <i>phaseolus</i>,
or kidney bean, takes the opposite direction. Neither <i>will</i>
be compelled to change its course. They <i>will</i> have their
own way, and grow as they please, or they <i>will</i> die in the
contest for liberty.</p>

<p>Arsenic has a <i>tendency</i> in itself, a latent power, which
only requires an opportunity suited to its objects, when it
<i>will act</i> in the most efficacious manner. It <i>will</i> destroy the
life of the Emperor, who has <i>voluntarily</i> slain his thousand
and tens of thousands. This secret power does not reside
in the flour of wheat, for that <i>will not</i>, has no tendency, to
produce such disastrous consequences.</p>

This word is applied in a similar manner to individuals
and nations. The man <i>will</i> fall, not of intention, but of accident.
He <i>will</i> kill himself. The man <i>will</i> drown, and
the boat <i>will</i> swim. The water <i>will</i> hold up the boat, but
it <i>will</i> allow the man to sink. The Russians <i>will</i> conquer
the Turks. If conquest depended solely on the <i>will</i>, the
Turks would as soon conquer as the Russians. But I have
not time to pursue this topic farther. You can follow out
these hints at your leisure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shall</span> signifies to be <i>bound</i>, <i>obligated</i>, or <i>required</i>, from
external necessity. Its etymology may be traced back
thro various languages. It is derived direct from the saxon
<i>scaelan</i> or <i>scylan</i>, and is found as a principal verb in that
language, as well as in ours. In the church homily they
say, "To Him alone we <i>schall us</i> to devote ourselves;" we
<i>bind</i> or <i>obligate</i> ourselves. Chaucer, an early english poet,
says.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The faith we <i>shall</i> to God."</p></div>

<p>Great difficulty has been found in distinguishing between
<i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, and frequent essays have been written, to
give arbitrary rules for their use. If the words were well
understood, there could be no difficulty in employing them
correctly. <i>Will</i> signifies <i>inherent tendency</i>, <i>aptitude</i>, or
<i>disposition</i>, and <i>volition</i> in beings capable of using it. <i>Shall</i>
implies <i>external necessity</i>, or foreign obligation. The parent
says, "You <i>will</i> suffer misery if you do evil," for it is in
accordance with the nature of things for evil to produce
misery. "You <i>shall</i> regard my wishes," for you are under
<i>obligation</i>, from the relation in which you stand to me, to
do so. Let these words be clearly explained, and there
will be no difficulty in using them correctly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">May</span>, past tense <i>might</i>. This verb expresses <i>power</i>,
<i>strength</i>, or <i>ability</i> to perform an action. It is a mistake
that it means permission or liberty only. It implies more
than that, the delegation of a power to perform the contemplated
action. Suppose the scholar should faint, would the
teacher say to him you <i>may</i> go into the open air? He has
no <i>power</i>, <i>might</i>, or <i>strength</i>, communicated by such liberty,
and must receive the <i>might</i> or strength of others to carry
him out. But to the scholar in health he says you <i>may</i> go
out, thereby giving to him a power and liberty sufficient to
perform the action. This is done on the same principle
that one man gives another a "<i>power</i> of attorney" to transact
his business; and that <i>power</i> constitutes his <i>liberty</i> of
action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Must</span> signifies to be <i>confined</i>, <i>limited</i>, <i>bound</i>, or <i>restrained</i>.
I <i>must</i>, or am bound, to obey; certain obligations require
me to obey. The adjective of this word is in common use.
The air in the cask is <i>musty</i>. It has long been <i>bound</i> or
<i>confined</i> there, and prevented from partaking of the purifying
qualities of the atmosphere, and hence has become
<i>musty</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Can.</span> This word is found as a principal verb and as a
noun in our language, especially in the Scotch dialect. "I
<i>ken</i> nae where he'd gone." Beyond the <i>ken</i> of mortals.
Far from all human <i>ken</i>. It signifies to <i>know</i>, to perceive,
to understand. I knew not where he had gone. Beyond
the knowledge of mortals. Far from all human reach.
To <i>con</i> or <i>cun</i> is a different spelling of the same word.
<i>Cunning</i> is that quick <i>perception</i> of things, which enables a
person to use his knowledge adroitly. The child <i>can</i>
read; <i>knows</i> how to read. It <i>can</i> walk. Here it seems
to imply <i>power</i>; but power, in this case, as in most others,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
is gained only by knowledge, for <span class="smcap">knowledge is power</span>.
Many children have strength sufficient to walk, long before
they do. The reason why they <i>can not</i> walk, is, they do
not <i>know how</i>; they have not learned to balance themselves
in an erect position, so as to move forward without
falling.</p>

<p>A vast proportion of human ability is derived from knowledge.
There is not a being in creation so entirely incapable
of self-support, as the new-born infant; and yet, by the
help of knowledge, he becomes the lord of this lower world.
Bonaparte was once as helpless as any other child, and yet
by dint of <i>can</i>, <i>ken</i>, <i>cunning</i>, or knowledge, he made all
Europe tremble. But his knowledge was limited. He became
blind to danger, bewildered by success, and he <i>could</i>
no longer follow the prudent course of wisdom, but fell a
sacrifice to his own unbridled ambition, and blinded folly.
An enlightened people <i>can</i> govern themselves; but <i>power</i>
of government is gained by a knowledge of the principles
of equality, and mutual help and dependency; and whenever
the people become ignorant of that fact, they <i>will</i> fall,
the degraded victims of their own folly, and the wily influence
of some more knowing aspirant for power.</p>

<p>This is a most important topic; but I dare not pursue it
farther, lest I weary your patience. A few examples <i>must</i>
suffice.</p>

<span class="smcap">Do</span> has been called a <i>helping</i> verb; but it needs little observation
to discover that it is no more so than a hundred
other words. "<i>Do</i> thy diligence to come before winter."
"<i>Do</i> the work of an evangelist."&mdash;<i>Paul to Timothy.</i> I <i>do</i>
all in my power <i>to expose</i> the error and wickedness of false
teaching. <i>Do</i> afford relief. <i>Do</i> something to afford relief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> has also been reckoned as an auxiliary by the
"helping verb grammars," which has no other duty to
perform than help conjugate other verbs thro some of their
moods and tenses. It is a word in very common use, and
of course must possess a very important character, which
should be carefully examined and distinctly known by all
who desire a knowledge of the construction of our language.</p>

<p>The principal difficulty in the explanation of this word,
is the peculiar meaning which some have attached to it. It
has been defined to denote <i>possession</i> merely. But when
we say, a man <i>has</i> much <i>property destroyed</i> by fire, we do
not mean that he <i>gains</i> or <i>possesses</i> much property by the
fire; nor can we make <i>has</i> auxiliary to <i>destroyed</i>, for in
that case it would stand thus: a man <i>has destroyed</i> much
property by fire, which would be false, for the destruction
was produced by an incendiary, or some other means wholly
unknown to him.</p>

<p>You at once perceive that <i>to possess</i> is not the only meaning
which attaches to <i>have</i>. It assumes a more important
rank. It can be traced, with little change in form, back
thro many generations. It is the same word as <i>heave</i>,
originally, and retains nearly the same meaning. Saxon
<i>habban</i>, Gothic <i>haban</i>, German <i>haben</i>, Latin <i>habeo</i>, French
<i>avoir</i>, are all the same word, varied in spelling more than
in sound; for <i>b</i> in many languages is sounded very much
like <i>v</i>, or <i>bv</i>. It may mean to <i>hold</i>, <i>possess</i>, <i>retain</i>, <i>sway</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
<i>control</i>, <i>dispose of</i>, either as a direct or <i>relative</i> action; for
a man sustains relations to his actors, duties, family, friends,
enemies, and all the world, as well as to his possessions.
He <i>has</i> a hard task to perform. He <i>has</i> much pain <i>to suffer</i>.
He <i>has</i> suffered much unhappiness.</p>

<p>I <i>have written</i> a letter. I <i>have</i> a written letter. I <i>have</i>
a letter <i>written</i>. These expressions differ very little in
meaning, but the verb <i>have</i> is the same in each case. By
the first expression, I signify that I have <i>caused</i> the letter to
be <i>written</i>; by the second that I have a letter on which
such action has been performed; and by the third, that such
written letter stands in such relation to myself.</p>

<p>I <i>have written</i> a letter and sent it away. <i>Written</i> is the
past participle from <i>write</i>; as an adjective it describes the
letter in the condition I placed it; so that it will be defined,
wherever it is found, as my letter; that is, some way <i>related</i>
to me.</p>

<p>We can here account for the old <i>perfect tense</i>, which is
said, "not only to refer to what is <i>past</i>, but also <i>to convey
an allusion to the present time</i>." The verb is in the <i>present</i>
tense, the participle is in the <i>past</i>, and hence the reason of
this allusion. I <i>have</i> no <i>space allowed</i> me to go into a full
investigation of this word, in its application to the expression
of ideas. But it is necessary to <i>have</i> it well <i>understood</i>, as
it <i>has</i> an important <i>service entrusted</i> to it; and I hope you
will <i>have</i> clear <i>views presented</i> to your minds, strong enough
to <i>have</i> former <i>errors eradicated</i> therefrom.</p>

<p>If you <i>have</i> leisure <i>granted</i>, and patience and disposition
equal-<i>ed</i> to the task, you have my consent to go back and
read this sentence over again. You will find it <i>has</i> in it
embodied much important information in relation to the use
of <i>have</i> and the perfect tense.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XIII" id="LECTURE_XIII"></a>LECTURE XIII.</h2>

<h3>ON VERBS.</h3>

<div class="summary"><p>Person and number in the agent, not in the action. &mdash; Similarity of
agents, actions, and objects. &mdash; Verbs made from nouns. &mdash; Irregular
verbs. &mdash; Some examples. &mdash; Regular Verbs. &mdash; <i>Ed</i>. &mdash; <i>Ing</i>. &mdash; Conjugation
of verbs. &mdash; To love. &mdash; To have. &mdash; To be. &mdash; The indicative
mood varied. &mdash; A whole sentence may be agent or object. &mdash; Imperative
mood. &mdash; Infinitive mood. &mdash; Is always future.</p></div>


<p>I have said before that action can never be known separate
from the actor; that the verb applies to the agent in
an <i>acting</i> condition, as that term has been defined and should
be understood. Hence Person and Number can never attach
to the verb, but to the agent with which, of course, the
action must, in every respect, agree; as, "<i>I write</i>." In
this case the action corresponds with myself. But to say
that <i>write</i> is in the "first person, singular number," would
be wrong, for no such number or person belongs to the
verb, but is confined to myself as the agent of the action.</p>

<p>The form of the verb is changed when it agrees with the
second or third person singular; more on account of habit,
I apprehend, than from any reason, or propriety as to a
change of meaning in the word. We say, when using the
regular <i>second</i> person singular, "<i>thou writest</i>," a form rarely
observed except in addresses to Deity, or on solemn occasions.
In the <i>third</i> person, an <i>s</i> is added to the regular
form; as, "<i>he writes</i>." The old form, which was in
gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>eral
use at the time the common version of the Bible was
published, was still different, ending in <i>eth</i>; as, <i>he thinketh</i>,
<i>he writeth</i>. This style, altho considerably used in the last
century, is nearly obsolete. When the verb agrees with
the plural number it is usually the same as when it agrees
with the first person; as, "<i>We write</i>, <i>you write</i>, <i>they write</i>."
There are few exceptions to these rules.</p>

<p>Some people have been very tenacious about retaining
the old forms of words, and our books were long printed
without alteration; but change will break thro every barrier,
and book-makers must keep pace with the times, and
put on the dress that is catered for them by the public taste;
bearing in mind, meanwhile, that great and practical truths
are more essential than the garb in which they appear.
We should be more careful of our health of body and purity
of morals than of the costume we put on. Many genteel
coats wrap up corrupt hearts, and fine hats cover silly
heads. What is the chaff to the wheat?</p>

<p>Even our good friends, the quakers, who have particularly
labored to retain old forms&mdash;"the plain language,"&mdash;have
failed in their attempt, and have substituted the <i>object</i>
form of the pronoun for the <i>agent</i>, and say, "<i>thee thinks</i>,"
for <i>thou thinkest</i>. Their mistake is even greater than the
substitution of <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>.</p>

<p>So far as language depends on the conventional regulation
of those who use it, it will be constantly changing;
new words will be introduced, and the spelling of old ones
altered, so as to agree with modern pronounciation. We
have all lived long enough to witness the truth of this remark.
The only rule we can give in relation to this matter
is, to follow our own judgments, aided by our best writers
and speakers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
The words which express action, are in many cases very
similar to the agents which produce them; and the objects
which are the direct results produced by such action, do
not differ very materially. I will give you a few examples.</p>

<p>I give you these examples to show you the near alliance
between <i>actors</i>, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,) and <i>actions</i>; or agents, <i>actions</i>, and objects.
Such expressions as the above are inelegant, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
they are uncommon; but for no other reason, for we, in
numberless cases, employ the same word for agent and
verb; as, <i>painters paint</i> buildings, and <i>artists</i> paint paintings;
<i>bookbinders bind books</i>; <i>printers print</i> books, and other
<i>prints</i>. A little observation will enable you to carry out
these hints, and profit by them. You have observed the
disposition in children, and foreigners, who are partially
acquainted with our language, to make verbs out of almost
every noun, which appears to us very aukward; but was
it common, it would be just as correct as the verbs now
used. There are very few verbs which have not a noun
to correspond with them, for we make verbs, that is, we
use words to express action, which are nearly allied to the
agent with which such action
agrees.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> From botany we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
have made <i>botanize</i>; from Mr. McAdam, the inventor of a
particular kind of road, <i>macadamize</i>, which means to make
roads as he made them. Words are formed in this way
very frequently. The word <i>church</i> is often used as a noun
to express a building used for public worship; for the services
performed in it; for the whole congregation; for a
portion of believers associated together; for the Episcopal
order, etc. It is also used as a verb. Mr. Webster defines
it, "To perform with any one the office of returning
thanks in the church after any signal deliverance." But
the word has taken quite a different turn of late. <i>To church</i>
a person, instead of receiving him into communion, as that
term would seem to imply, signifies to deal with an offending
member, to excommunicate, or turn him out.</p>

<p>But I will not pursue this point any farther. The brief
hints I have thrown out, will enable you to discover how the
meaning and forms of words are changed from their original
application to suit the notions and improvements of after
ages. A field is here presented which needs cultivation.
The young should be taught to search for the etymology
of words, to trace their changes and meaning as used at
different times and by different people, keeping their minds
constantly directed to the object signified by such verbal
sign. This is the business of philosophy, under whatever
name it may be taught; for grammar, rhetoric, logic, and
the science of the mind, are intimately blended, and should
always be taught in connexion. We have already seen
that words without meaning are like shadows without realities.
And persons can not employ language "correctly,"
or "with propriety," till they have acquainted themselves
with the import of such language&mdash;the ideas of things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
signified by it. Let this course be adopted in the education
of children, and they will not be required to spend
months and years in the study of an "<i>art</i>" which they can
not comprehend, for the simple reason that they can not
apply it in practice. Grammar has been taught as a mere
<i>art</i>, depending on arbitrary rules to be mechanically learned,
rather than a science involving the soundest and plainest
principles of philosophy, which are to be known only as
developed in common practice among men, and in accordance
with the permanent laws which govern human thought.</p>

<p>Verbs differ in the manner of forming their <i>past</i> tenses,
and participles, or adjectives. Those ending in <i>ed</i> are
called <i>regular</i>; those which take any other termination are
<i>irregular</i>. There are about two hundred of the latter in
our language, which differ in various ways. Some of them
have the <i>past</i> tense and the past participle the same; as,</p>

<p>The syllable <i>ed</i> is a contraction of the past tense of <i>do</i>;
as, I <i>loved</i>, love <i>did</i>, <i>did</i> love, or love-<i>ed</i>. He learn<i>ed</i>,
learn did, did learn, or learned. It signifies action, <i>did</i>,
done, or accomplished. You have all lived long enough to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
have noticed the change in the pronounciation of this syllable.
Old people sound it full and distinct; and so do most
others in reading the scriptures; but not so generally as in
former times. In poetry it was usually abbreviated so as
to avoid the full sound; and hence we may account for the
<i>irregular</i> termination of many words, such as <i>heard</i>, for
<i>heared</i>; <i>past</i>, for <i>passed</i>; <i>learnt</i>, for <i>learned</i>; <i>built</i>, for
<i>builded</i>. In modern poetry, however, the <i>e</i> is retained, tho
sounded no more than formerly.</p>

<p><i>Ing</i> is derived from the verb to <i>be</i>, and signifies <i>being</i>,
<i>existing</i>; and, attached to a verb, is used as a noun, or adjective,
retaining so much of its former character as to
have an object after it which is affected by it; as, "I am
<i>writing</i> a lecture." Here <i>writing</i>, the present participle of
<i>write</i>, describes myself in my present employment, and yet
retains its action as a verb, and terminates on <i>lecture</i> as the
thing written. "The man was taken in the act of <i>stealing</i>
some money." In this case <i>stealing</i> names the action which
the man was performing when detected, which action thus
named, has <i>money</i> for the object on which it terminates.</p>

<p>I barely allude to this subject in this place to give you
an idea of the method we adopt to explain the meaning and
use of participles. It deserves more attention, perhaps, to
make it plain to your minds; but as it is not an essential
feature in the new system, I shall leave it for consideration
in a future work. Whoever is acquainted with the formation
of the present participle in other languages, can carry
out the suggestions I have made, and fully comprehend my
meaning.</p>

<p>I will present you with an example of the conjugations
of a few verbs which you are requested to compare with
the "<i>might could would should have been loved</i>" systems,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
which you were required to learn in former times. You

<p>These examples will suffice to give you an idea of the
ease and simplicity of the construction of verbs, and by a
comparison with old systems, you can, for yourselves, determine
the superiority of the principles we advocate. The
above tabular views present every form which the verb assumes,
and every position in which it is found. In use,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
these words are frequently compounded
together;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but with
a knowledge of the above principles, and the <i>meaning</i> of
the words&mdash;a most essential consideration&mdash;you will always
be able to analyze any sentence, and parse it correctly. I
have not time to enlarge on this point, to show how words
are connected together. Nor do I think it necessary to
enable you to understand my views. To children such a
work would be indispensable, and shall be attended to if we
are able to publish a grammar containing the simple principles
of language.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p>The indicative mood is varied four ways. 1st, affirmatively,
<i>he writes</i>; 2d, negatively, <i>he writes not</i>; 3d, interrogatively,
<i>does</i> he write? or <i>writes</i> he? 4th, suppositively,
if <i>he writes</i>, <i>suppose he writes</i>, allow <i>he writes</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> is a simple affirmation of a fact, and is easily
understood. The <i>second</i> is formed by annexing a term to
express negation. <i>Not</i> is a contraction from <i>nought</i> or
<i>naught</i>, which is a compound of <i>ne</i>, negative, and ought or
aught, <i>ne-aught</i>, meaning <i>no-thing</i>. <i>He writes not</i>; he
writes nothing. He does <i>not</i> write; he does <i>nothing</i> to
write. <i>Neither</i> is a compound of <i>ne</i> and <i>either</i>, <i>not either</i>.
He <i>can not</i> read; he <i>can</i>, <i>kens</i>, <i>knows nothing</i>, has no
ability <i>to read</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
The third is constructed into a question by placing the
verb before the agent, or by prefixing another word before
the agent, and then placing the former verb as an infinitive
after it; as, <i>Does</i> he write? or <i>writes</i> he? When another
verb is prefixed, one is always chosen which will best decide
the query. Does he <i>any thing</i> to write? Does he
make any motions or show any indications to write? When
the <i>will</i> or disposition of a person is concerned, we choose
a word accordingly. <i>Will</i> he write? Has he the <i>will</i> or
disposition to write? <i>Can</i> he write? Is he able&mdash;<i>knows</i>
he how to write? A little observation will enable you to
understand my meaning.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, a supposition is made in the imperative
mood, in accordance with which the action is performed.
"<i>If</i> ye <i>love</i> me, keep my commandments." <i>Give</i>, <i>grant</i>,
<i>allow</i>, <i>suppose</i> this fact&mdash;you <i>love</i> me, keep my commandments.
I will go if I can. I <i>resolve</i>, <i>will</i>, or <i>determine</i> to
go; <i>if</i>, <i>gif</i>, <i>give</i>, grant, allow this fact, I <i>can</i>, <i>ken</i>, <i>know</i>
how, or <i>am</i> able <i>to go</i>. But more on this point when we
come to the consideration of contractions.</p>

<p>In this mood the verb must have an agent and object,
expressed or implied; as, "<i>farmers</i> cultivate the <i>soil</i>."
But a whole sentence, that is, an idea written out, may perform
this duty; as, "The study of grammar, on false principles,
is productive of no good." What is productive of no
good? What is the agent of <i>is</i>? "The <i>study</i>," our books
and teachers tell us. But does such a construction give
the true meaning of the sentence? I think not, for <i>study</i> is
indispensable to knowledge and usefulness, and <i>the study</i>
of grammar, properly directed, is a most useful branch of
literature, which should never be dispensed with. It is the
study of grammar <i>on false principles</i>, which <i>is productive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of no good</i>. You discover my meaning, and will not question
its correctness. You must also see how erroneous it
would be to teach children that "<i>to study</i> is productive of
no good." The force of the sentence rests on the "false
principles" taught. Hence the whole statement is truly the
agent of the verb.</p>

<p>The object on which the action terminates is frequently
expressed in a similar manner; as, "He wrote to me, that
he will adopt the new system of grammar, if he can procure
some books to give his scholars to learn." Will you
parse <i>wrote</i>? Most grammarians will call it an <i>intransitive</i>
verb, and make out that "he wrote" <i>nothing</i> to me, because
there is no regular objective word after it. Will you parse
<i>that</i>? It is a "conjunction <i>copulative</i>." What does it connect?
"<i>He wrote</i>" to the following sentence, according to
Rule 18 of Mr. Murray; "conjunctions connect the <i>same</i>
moods and tenses of verbs and cases of nouns and pronouns."
Unluckily you have two different tenses connected
in this case. Will you parse <i>if</i>? It is a <i>copulative</i> conjunction,
connecting the two members of the sentence&mdash;<i>he
will adopt</i> if <i>he can procure</i>: Rule, as above. How exceeding
unfortunate! You have <i>two</i> different moods, and
too different tenses, connected by a <i>copulative</i> conjunction
which the rule says "connects <i>the same</i> moods and tenses!
What nonsense! What a falsehood! What a fine thing
to be a grammarian! And yet, I venture the opinion, and
I judge from what I have seen in myself and others, there
is not one teacher in a hundred who will not learn children
to parse as above, and apply the same rule to it. "I <i>will
go</i> if I <i>can</i>." "I <i>do</i> and <i>will</i> contend." "As it <i>was</i> in the
beginning, <i>is</i> now, <i>and</i> ever <i>shall be</i>." "I <i>am</i> here and <i>must</i>
remain." "He <i>will do</i> your business <i>if</i> he <i>has</i> time." "I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
<i>am</i> resolved <i>to expose</i> the errors of grammar, <i>and will do</i> it
thoroly <i>if</i> I <i>can</i>."</p>

<p>In these examples you have different moods and tenses,
indiscriminately, yet correctly coupled together, despite the
rules of syntax which teach us to explain language "with
propriety."</p>

<p><i>That</i>, in the sentence before us, is an adjective, referring
to the following sentence, which is the <i>object</i> of <i>wrote</i>, or is
the thing written. "He wrote to me <i>that</i>" fact, sentiment,
opinion, determination, or resolution, that writing, letter, or
word&mdash;"he will adopt the new system of grammar, if he
can procure some books."</p>

<p>This subject properly belongs to that department of language
called syntax; but as I shall not be able to treat of
that in this course of lectures, I throw in here these brief
remarks to give you some general ideas of the arrangement
of words into sentences, according to their true meaning, as
obtained from a knowledge of their etymology. You cannot
fail to observe this method of constructing language if
you will pay a little attention to it when reading; keeping
all the time in view the fact that words are only the signs
of ideas, derived from an observation of things. You all
know that it is not merely the steam that propels the boat,
but that it is steam <i>applied to machinery</i>. Steam is the
more latent cause; and the engine with its complicated
parts is the direct means. In the absence of either, the boat
would not be propelled. In the formation of language, I
may say correctly, "Solomon <i>built</i> the temple;" for he
stood in that relation to the matter which supposes it would
not have been built without his direction and command.
To accomplish such an action, however, he need not raise
a hammer or a gavel, or draw a line on the trestle board.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
His command made known to his ministers was sufficient to
<i>cause</i> the work to be done. Hence the whole fact is <i>indicated</i>
or declared by the single expression, "Solomon <i>built</i>
the temple."</p>

<p>The Imperative mood is unchanged in form. I can say
to one man, <i>go</i>, or to a thousand, <i>go</i>. The commander
when drilling <i>one</i> soldier, says, <i>march</i>; and he bids the
whole battalion, <i>march</i>. The agent who is <i>to perform</i> the
action is understood when not expressed; as, <i>go</i>, <i>go thou</i>,
or <i>go you</i>. The agent is generally omitted, because the address
is given direct to the person who is expected to obey
the instruction, request, or command. This verb always
agrees with an agent in the <i>second</i> person. And yet our
"grammars made easy" have given us <i>three persons</i> in this
mood&mdash;"<i>Let me love</i>; <i>love</i>, <i>love thou</i>, or <i>do</i> thou <i>love</i>; let
him love." In the name of common sense, I ask, what can
children learn by such instruction? "<i>Let me love</i>," in the
conjugation of the verb <i>to love</i>! To whom is this command
given? To <i>myself</i> of course! I command myself to "<i>let
me love</i>!" What nonsense! "Let <i>him</i> love." I stand
here, you set there, and the <i>third</i> person is in Philadelphia.
I utter these words, "Let <i>him love</i>." What is my
meaning? Why, our books tell us, that the verb to <i>love</i> is
<i>third</i> person. Then I command <i>him</i> to <i>let himself love</i>!
What jargon and falsehood! You all know that we can
address the <i>second</i> person only. You would call me insane
if I should employ language according to the rules of grammar
as laid down in the standard books. In my room
alone, no person near me, I cry out, "<i>let me be quiet</i>"&mdash;imperative
mood, first person of <i>to be</i>! Do I command myself
to <i>let</i> myself <i>be</i> quiet? Most certainly, if <i>be</i> is the principal
verb in the first person, and <i>let</i> the auxiliary. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
teacher observes one of his pupils take a pencil from a
classmate who sets near him. He says, "<i>let him have it</i>."
To whom is the command given? It is the imperative
mood, third person of the verb <i>to have</i>. Does he command
the third person, the boy who <i>has</i> not the pencil? Such is
the resolution of the sentence, according to the authority of
standard grammars. But where is there a child five years
old who does not know better. Every body knows that he
addresses the second person, the boy who has the pencil, to
<i>let</i> the other <i>have</i> it.</p>

<p>Teachers have learned their scholars the <i>first</i> and <i>third</i>
persons of this mood when committing the conjugation of
verbs; but not one in ten thousand ever adopted them in
parsing. "<i>Let me love.</i>" <i>Let</i>, all parse, Mr. Murray not
excepted, in the <i>second</i> person, and <i>love</i> in the infinitive
mood after it, without the sign <i>to</i>; according to the rule,
that "verbs which follow <i>bid</i>, <i>dare</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>hear</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>needs</i>,
<i>speak</i>," etc. are in the infinitive mood. It is strange people
will not eat their own cooking.</p>

<p>There can be no trouble in understanding this mood, as
we have explained it, always in the future tense, that is,
future to the command or request, agreeing with the <i>second</i>
person, and never varied on account of number.</p>

<p>The only variation in the infinitive mood is the omission
of <i>to</i> in certain cases, which is considered as a part of the
verb; tho in truth it is no more so than when used in the
character of an old fashioned preposition. In certain cases,
as we have before observed, it is not expressed. This is
when the infinitive verb follows small words in frequent use;
as, shall, will, let, can, must, may, bid, do, have, make, feel,
hear, etc.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
This mood is always in the future tense; that is, it is future
to the circumstances or condition of things upon which
it depends; as, they are making preparations <i>to raise</i> the
building. Here <i>to raise</i> is future to the preparations, for if
they make no preparations, the buildings will not be raised.
The boy studies his book <i>to learn</i> his lesson. If he does
not study, he will not be likely <i>to learn</i> his lesson.</p>

<p>The allied powers of Europe combined their forces <i>to
defeat</i> Napoleon. In this instance the whole expression is
in the past tense; nevertheless, the action expressed in the
infinitive mood, <i>was future</i> to the circumstance on which it
depended; that is, the <i>defeat</i> was <i>future</i> to the <i>combination</i>
of the forces. Abraham raised the knife <i>to slay</i> his son.
Not that he did <i>slay</i> him, as that sentence must be explained
on the common systems, which teach us that <i>to slay</i> is
in the <i>present tense</i>; but he raised the fatal knife for that
purpose, the fulfilment of which was future; but the angel
staid his hand, and averted the blow. The patriots of Poland
<i>made</i> a noble attempt <i>to gain</i> their liberty. But they
did not <i>gain it</i>, as our grammars would teach us. <i>To gain</i>
was future to the attempt, and failed because the circumstances
<i>indicated</i> by the event, were insufficient to produce
so favorable a result.</p>

<p>No person of common discernment can fail to observe
the absolute falsehood of existing systems in respect to this
mood. It is used by our authors of grammar in the <i>present</i>
and <i>past</i> tenses, but never in the <i>future</i>. Let us give a
moment to the consideration of this matter. Take the following
example. He <i>will prepare</i> himself next week <i>to go</i>
to Europe. Let the school master parse <i>will prepare</i>. It
is a verb, indicative mood, <i>first future</i> tense. <i>Next week</i> is
the point in futurity when the <i>preparation</i> will be <i>made</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Now parse <i>to go</i>. It is a verb, infinitive mood, <i>present
tense</i>! Then <i>he</i> is already on his way to Europe, when
he is not <i>to prepare</i> himself till next week! An army is
collected <i>to fight</i> the enemy. Is the fight already commenced?
<i>To fight</i> is present tense, say the books. We shall
study grammar next year, <i>to obtain</i> a knowledge of the
principles and use of language. Is <i>to obtain</i> present tense?
If so there is little need of spending time and money to study
for a knowledge we <i>already possess</i>.</p>

Much more might be said upon the character and use of
verbs; but as these lectures are not designed for <i>a system</i>
of grammar <i>to be taught</i>, but to expose the errors of existing
systems, and prepare the way for a more rational and consistent
exposition of language, I shall leave this department
of our subject, presuming you will be able to comprehend
our views, and appreciate their importance. We have been
somewhat critical in a part of our remarks, and more brief
than we should have been, had we not found that we were
claiming too much of the time of the Institute, which is designed
as a means of improvement on general subjects.
Enough has been said, I am sure, to convince you, if you
were not convinced before, why the study of grammar is
so intricate and tedious, that it is to be accounted for from
the fact that the theories by which it is taught are false in
principle, and can not be adopted in practice; and that
something ought to be done to make the study of language
easy, interesting, and practical. Such a work is here attempted;
but it remains with the public to say whether
these plain philosophical principles shall be sustained, matured,
perfected, and adopted in schools, or the old roundabout
course of useless and ineffectual teaching be still
preserved.</p>

<p>We have concluded our remarks on the necessary divisions
of words. Things <i>named</i>, <i>defined</i> and <i>described</i>, and
their <i>actions</i>, <i>relations</i>, and <i>tendencies</i>, have been considered
under the classes of Nouns, Adjectives, and Verbs. To
these classes all words belong when properly explained; a
fact we desire you to bear constantly in mind in all your
attempts to understand and employ language. But there
are many words in our language as well as most others,
which are so altered and disguised that their meaning is not
easily comprehended. Of course they are difficult of explanation.
These words we have classed under the head
of <i>Contractions</i>, a term better calculated than any other we
have seen adopted to express their character. We do not
however lay any stress on the appropriateness of this appellation,
but adopt it as a temporary expedient, till these
words shall be better understood. They will then be ranked
in their proper places among the classes already noticed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Under this head may be considered the words usually
known as "adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections."
That the etymology and meaning of these words
have not been generally understood will be conceded, I presume,
on all hands. In our opinion, that is the only reason
why they have been considered under these different heads,
for in numberless cases there is nothing in their import to
correspond with such distinctions. Why "an adverb expresses
some <i>quality</i> or circumstance respecting a verb, adjective,
or other adverb;" why "a conjunction is chiefly
used to connect sentences, so as out of <i>two</i> to make only <i>one</i>
sentence;" or why "prepositions serve to connect words
with one another, and show the relation between them," has
never been explained. They have been <i>passed over</i> with
little difficulty by teachers, having been furnished with lists
of words in each "part of speech," which they require their
pupils to commit to memory, and "for ever after hold
their peace" concerning them. But that these words have
been defined or explained in a way to be understood will
not be pretended. In justification of such ignorance, it is
contended that such explanation is not essential to their
proper and elegant use. If such is the fact, we may easily
account for the incorrect use of language, and exonerate
children from the labor of studying etymology.</p>

<p>But these words have meaning, and sustain a most important
rank in the expression of ideas. They are, generally,
abbreviated, compounded, and so disguised that their
origin and formation are not generally known. Horne
Tooke calls them "the <i>wheels</i> of language, the <i>wings</i> of
Mercury." He says "tho we might be dragged along
without them, it would be with much difficulty, very heavily
and tediously." But when he undertakes to show that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
were <i>constructed</i> for this object, he mistakes their true character;
for they were not invented for that purpose, but
were originally employed as nouns or verbs, from which
they have been corrupted by use. And he seems to admit
this fact when he says,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
"<i>abbreviation</i> and <i>corruption</i> are
always busiest with the words which are most frequently
in use. Letters, like soldiers, being very apt to desert and
drop off in a long march, and especially if their passage
happens to lie near the confines of an enemy's country."</p>

<p>In the original construction of language a set of literary
men did not get together and manufacture a lot of words,
finished thro out and exactly adapted to the expression of
thought. Had that been the case, language would doubtless
have appeared in a much more regular, stiff, and formal
dress, and been deprived of many of its beautiful and lofty
figures, its richest and boldest expressions. Necessity is
the mother of invention. It was not until people had <i>ideas</i>
to communicate, that they sought a medium for the transmission
of thought from one to another; and then such
sounds and signs were adopted as would best answer their
purpose. But language was not then framed like a cotton
mill, every part completed before it was set in operation.
Single expressions, <i>sign</i>-ificant of things, or <i>ideas</i> of <i>things</i>
and <i>actions</i>, were first employed, in the most simple, plain,
and easy manner.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
As the human mind advanced in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
knowledge, by observing the character, relations, and differences
of things, words were changed, altered, compounded,
and contracted, so as to keep pace with such advancement;
just as many simple parts of a machine, operating
on perfect and distinct principles, may be combined together
and form a most complicated, curious, and powerful engine,
of astonishing power, and great utility. In the adaptation
of steam to locomotives, the principles on which stationary
engines operated were somewhat modified. Some wheels,
shafts, bands, screws, etc., were omitted, others of a different
kind were added, till the whole appeared in a new character,
and the engine, before fixed to a spot, was seen
traversing the road with immense rapidity. The principles
of the former engine, so far from being unessential, were
indispensable to the construction of the new one, and should
be clearly understood by him who would build or <i>use</i> the
latter. So, in the formation of language, simple <i>first</i> principles
must be observed and traced thro all their ramifications,
by those who would obtain a clear and thoro knowledge
of it, or "read and write it with propriety."</p>

<p>In mathematics, the four simple rules, addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division, form the basis on which
that interesting science depends. The modifications of these
rules, according to their various capabilities, will give a
complete knowledge of all that can be known of numbers,
relations, and proportions, an acme to which all may aspire,
tho none have yet attained it. The principles of language
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
are equally simple, and, if correctly explained, may be as
well understood. But the difficulty under which we labor
in this department of science, is the paucity of <i>means</i> to
trace back to their <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original text reads 'orignal'">original</ins>
form and meaning many words
and phrases in common use among us. Language has been
employed as the vehicle of thought, for six thousand years,
and in that long space has undergone many and strange
modifications. At the dispersion from Babel, and the
"confusion of tongues" occasioned thereby, people were
thrown upon their own resources, and left to pick up by
piecemeal such shreds as should afterwards be wove into a
system, and adopted by their respective nations. Wars,
pestilence, and famine, as well as commerce, enterprize,
literature, and religion, brought the different nations into
intercourse with each other; and changes were thus produced
in the languages of such people. Whoever will take
the trouble to compare the idioms of speech adopted by
those nations whose affairs, civil, political, and religious, are
most intimately allied, will be convinced of the correctness
of the sentiment now advanced.</p>

<p>In the lapse of ages, words would not only change their
form, but in a measure their meaning, so as to correspond
with the ideas of those who use them. Some would become
obsolete, and others be adopted in their stead. Many words
are found in the Bible which are not in common use; and
the manner of spelling, as well as some entire words, have
been changed in that book, since it was translated and first
published in 1610. With these examples you are familiar,
and I shall be spared the necessity of quoting them. I have
already made some extracts from old writers, and may have
occasion to do so again before I close this lecture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
The words which we class under the head of Contractions,
are so altered and disguised in their appearance, that
their etymology and connexion are not generally understood.
It may appear like pedantry in me to attempt an investigation
into their origin and meaning. But to avoid that
charge, I will frankly acknowledge the truth, and own my
inability to do justice to this subject, by offering a full explanation
of all the words which belong to this class. I
will be candid, if I am not successful. But I think most of
the words long considered difficult, may be easily explained;
enough to convince you of the feasibility of the ground we
have assumed, and furnish a sample by which to pursue the
subject in all our future inquiries into the etymology of
words.</p>

<p>But even if I fail in this matter, I shall have one comfort
left, that I am not alone in the transgression; for no philologist,
with few exceptions, has done any thing like justice
to this subject. Our common grammars have not even
attempted an inquiry into the <i>meaning</i> of these words, but
have treated them as tho they had none. Classes, like
pens or reservoirs, are made for them, into which they are
thrown, and allowed to rest, only to be named, without being
disturbed. Sometimes, however, they are found in one
enclosure, sometimes in another, more by mistake, I apprehend,
than by intention; for "prepositions" under certain
circumstances are parsed as "adverbs," and "adverbs" as
"adjectives," and "conjunctions" as either "adverbs" or
"prepositions;" and not unfrequently the whole go off together,
like the tail of the dragon, drawing other respectable
words along with them, under the sweeping cognomen
of "adverbial phrases," or "conjunctive expressions;" as,
Can you write your lesson? <i>Not yet quite well enough.</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
"<i>But and if</i> that evil
servant,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
etc. Mr. Murray says,
"the same word is occasionally used <i>both as</i> a conjunction
<i>and as</i> an adverb, and sometimes <i>as</i> a preposition.</p>

<p>Let these words be correctly defined, their meaning be
ferreted out from the rubbish in which they have been enclosed;
or have their dismembered parts restored to them,
they will then appear in their true character, and their connexion
with other words will be found regular and easy. Until
such work is accomplished, they may as well be called
contractions, for such they <i>mostly</i> are, as adverbs or any
thing else; for that appellation we regard as more appropriate
than any other.</p>

<p>In the attempts we are about to make, we shall endeavor
to be guided by sound philosophic principles and the light
of patient investigation; and whatever advances we may
make shall be in strict accordance with the true and practical
use of these words.</p>

<p>Let us begin with <i>Adverbs</i>.</p>

<p>I have not time to go into a thoro investigation of the mistakes
into which grammarians have fallen in their attempts
to explain this "part of speech." Mr. Murray says they
"seem originally to have been <i>contrived</i> to express compendiously
in <i>one word</i>, what must <i>otherwise</i> have required two
or more; as, "he acted <i>wisely</i>." They could have been
"<i>contrived</i>" for no such purpose, for we have already seen
that they are made up of various words combined together,
which are used to express relation, to define or describe
other things. Take the very example Mr. M. has given.
<i>Wisely</i> is made up of two words; <i>wise</i> and <i>like</i>. "He acted
wisely," wise-like. What did he <i>act</i>? <i>Wisely</i>, we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
taught, expresses the "<i>manner</i> or quality" of the verb <i>act</i>.
But <i>act</i>, in this case, is a neuter or intransitive verb, and
<i>wisely</i> expresses the <i>manner of action</i> where there is none!
But he must have <i>acted something</i> which was <i>wise</i> like something
else. What did he act? If he produced no <i>actions</i>,
how can it be known that he <i>acted</i> wisely or unwisely?
<i>Action</i> or <i>acts</i> is the direct object of to <i>act</i>. Hence the sentence
fully stated would stand thus: "He acted <i>acts</i> or <i>actions</i>
like wise actions or acts." But stated at length, it appears
aukward and clumsy, like old fashioned vehicles. We
have modified, improved, cut down, and made eliptical, all
of our expressions, as we have previously observed, to suit
the fashions and customs of the age in which we live; the
same as tailors cut our garments to correspond with the
latest fashions.</p>

<p>"The bird sings <i>sweetly</i>." The bird sings <i>songs</i>, <i>notes</i>,
or <i>tunes</i>, <i>like sweet notes</i>, <i>tunes,</i> or <i>songs</i>. The comparison
here made, is not in reference to the agent or action, but the
<i>object</i> of the action; and this explains the whole theory of
those <i>adverbs</i>, which are said to "qualify manner" of action.
We have already seen that no <i>action</i>, as such, can
exist, or be conceived to exist, separate(-ed) from the <i>thing</i>
or <i>agent</i> which <i>acts</i>; and such action can only be determined
by the <i>changed</i> or altered condition of something
which is the <i>object</i> of such action. How then, can any
word, in truth, or in thought, be known to <i>qualify</i> the action,
as distinct from the object or agent? And if it does not in
<i>fact</i>, how can we explain words to children, or to our own
minds, so as to understand what is not true?</p>

<p>Hence all words of this character are adjectives, describing
one thing by its relation or likeness to another, and as
such, admit of comparison; as, a likely man, a <i>very</i> likely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
man, a likelier, and the <i>likeliest</i> man. "He is the <i>most
likely</i> pedlar I ever knew." "He is <i>more liable</i> to be deceived."
"A <i>lively</i> little fellow." "He is worthless."
He is worth less, <i>less worthy</i> of respect and confidence. "He
writes very correctly." He writes his letters and words
<i>like very correct</i> letters. But I need not enlarge. You
have only to bear in mind the fact, that <i>ly</i> is a contraction
of <i>like</i>, which is often retained in many words; as god<i>like</i>,
christian<i>like</i>, etc., and search for a definition accordingly;
and you will find no trouble in disposing of a large portion
of this adverb family.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, and should be maturely considered by
all who still adhere to the neuter verb theory, that adverbs
<i>qualify neuter</i> as well as active verbs, and express the <i>quality</i>
or <i>manner of action</i>, where there is none! Adverbs express
"manner of action" in a neuter verb! When a person
starts wrong it is very difficult to go right. The safest
course is to return back and start again.</p>

<p>Adverbs have been divided into classes, varying from
<i>eleven</i> to <i>seventy-two</i>, to suit the fancies of those who have
only observed the nice shades of form which these words
have assumed. But a bonnet is a bonnet, let its shape,
form, or fashion, be what it may. You may put on as
many trimmings, flowers, bows, and ribbons, as you please;
it is a bonnet still; and when we speak of it we will call it
a <i>bonnet</i>, and talk about its <i>appendages</i>. But when it is
constructed into something else, then we will give it a new
name.</p>

<p>Adjectives, we have said, are <i>derived</i> from either nouns
or verbs, and we now contend that the words formerly regarded
as adverbs are either adjectives, nouns, or verbs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
In defence of this sentiment we will adduce a few words in
this place for examples.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ago.</span> "Three years <i>ago</i>, we dwelt in the country."
This word is a past participle from the verb <i>ago</i>, meaning
the same as <i>gone</i> or <i>agone</i>, and was so used a few centuries
<i>ago</i>&mdash;<i>agone</i>, or <i>gone by</i>.</p>

<p>"In these provynces the fayth of Chryste was all

<p>A numerous portion of these contractions are nouns,
which, from their frequent recurrence, are used without
their usual connexion with small words. The letter <i>a</i> is
compounded with many of these words, which may have
been joined to them by habit, or as a preposition, meaning
<i>on</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>in</i>, as it is used in the french and some other languages.
You often hear expressions like these, "he is <i>a</i>-going;
he is <i>a</i>-writing; he began <i>a</i>-new," etc. The old
adverbs which take this letter, you can easily analyze; as,
"The house is <i>a</i>-fire"&mdash;on fire; "He fell <i>a</i>-sleep"&mdash;he fell
<i>on</i> sleep. "When deep sleep falleth on men."&mdash;<i>Job.</i>
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original lacks &quot;">"He</ins>

"They put it <i>a</i>-foot"&mdash;on foot. "He went <i>a</i>-way"&mdash;a way,
followed some <i>course</i>, to a distance. "Blue bonnets are all

<p>Examples of this kind might be multiplied to an indefinite
length. But the above will suffice to give you an idea of
the former use of these words, and also, by comparison with
the present, of the changes which have taken place in the
method of spelling within a few centuries.</p>

<p>A large portion of adverbs relate to <i>time</i> and <i>place</i>, because
many of our ideas, and much of our language, are
employed in reference to them; as, <i>then</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, <i>there</i>,
<i>here</i>, <i>hence</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>thence</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>till</i>, <i>whether</i>, etc. These
are compound words considerably disguised in their meaning
and formation. Let us briefly notice some of them.</p>

<p><i>Per annum</i> is a latin phrase, <i>for the year</i>, a <i>year</i>; and
<i>the annum</i> is <i>the year</i>, <i>round</i> or <i>period</i> of time, from which
it was corrupted gradually into its present shape. <i>Thanne</i>,
tha anne, <i>thane</i>, <i>thenne</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>than</i>, are different forms of the
same word.</p>

<p>"We see nowe bi a mirror in darcnesse: thanne forsathe,
face to face. Nowe I know of partye; <i>thanne</i> forsathe
schal know as I am knowen."&mdash;1. Cor. 13: 12.
<i>Translation in 1350.</i></p>

<p>I have a translation of the same passage in 1586, which
stands thus: "For nowe we see through a glasse darkley:
but <i>thene</i> face to face: now I know in part: but <i>then</i> shal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
I know even as I am knowen." Here several words are
spelled differently in the same verse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span>, <i>the anne</i>, that time.
<span class="smcap">When</span>, <i>wha anne</i>, "<i>wha-icht-anne</i>,"
which, or what <i>anne</i>, period of time.</p>

<p><i>Area</i> means an open space, a plat of ground, a spot or
place. Arena is from the same etymon, altered in application.
<span class="smcap">There</span>, <i>the area</i>, the <i>place</i> or <i>spot</i>. "If we go <i>there</i>,"
to that place. <span class="smcap">Where</span>, which, or what ("wha-icht area")
place. <span class="smcap">Here</span>, <i>his</i> (latin word for <i>this</i>,) <i>area</i>, this place.
These words refer to <i>place</i>, <i>state</i>, or <i>condition</i>.</p>

<p><i>While</i> is another spelling for <i>wheel</i>. "To while away
our time," is to <i>pass</i>, spend, or <i>wheel</i> it away. <i>While</i> applies
to the <i>period</i>, or space of time, in which something
<i>wheels</i>, <i>whirls</i>, <i>turns</i> round, or transpires; as, "You had
better remain here <i>while</i> (during the time) he examines
whether it is prudent for you to go."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Till</span> is <i>to while</i>, to the <i>period</i> at which something is expected
to follow. "If I will that he tarry <i>till</i> (to the time)
I come what is that to thee?"</p>

<p>The idea of <i>time</i> and <i>place</i> are often blended together.
It is not uncommon to hear lads and professed scholars, in
some parts of our country say "down <i>till</i> the bottom, over
<i>till</i> the woods." etc. Altho we do not regard such expressions
correct, yet they serve to explain the meaning of the
word. The only mistake is in applying it to <i>place</i> instead
of <i>time</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> is <i>which either</i>. "Shew <i>whether</i> of these <i>two</i>
thou hast chosen."&mdash;<i>Acts 1: 24.</i> It is more frequently applied
in modern times to circumstance and events <i>than to</i>
persons and things. "I will let you know <i>whether</i> I <i>will</i>
or <i>will not</i> adopt it," one or the other.</p>

It is always used with the comparative degree, to define
particularly the object with which the comparison is made.
Talent is better than flattery. Than flattery, often bestowed
regardless of merit, talent is better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> is an adjective, in extensive use. It means the, this,
that, these, the same, etc. It is a defining word of the first
kind. You practice <i>as</i> you have been taught&mdash;<i>the same
duties</i> or <i>principles</i> understood. We use language <i>as</i> we
have learned it; in <i>the same</i> way or manner. It is often
associated with other words to particularly specify the way,
manner, or degree, in which something is done or compared.
I can go <i>as well as</i> you. In <i>the same well</i>, easy, convenient
way or manner you can go, I can go in <i>the same</i> way. He
was <i>as</i> learned, <i>as</i> pious, <i>as</i> benevolent, <i>as</i> brave, <i>as</i> faithful,
<i>as</i> ardent. These are purely adjectives, used to denote the
degree of the likeness or similarity between the things compared.
Secondary words are often added to this, to aid the
distinction or definition; as, (<i>the same</i> illustrated,) He is <i>just
as willing</i>. I am <i>quite as well</i> pleased without it. <i>As</i>, like
many other adjectives, often occurs without a noun expressed,
in which case it was formerly parsed by Murray
himself <i>as</i> (like, or the same) a relative pronoun; as, "And
indeed it seldom at any period extends to the tip, <i>as happens</i>
in acute diseases."&mdash;<i>Dr. Sweetster.</i> "The ground I have
assumed is tenable, <i>as will appear</i>."&mdash;<i>Webster.</i>
"Bona<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>parte
had a special motive in decorating Paris, for 'Paris
is France, <i>as has</i> often been observed."&mdash;<i>Channing.</i> "The
words are such <i>as seem</i>."&mdash;<i>Murray's Reader! p. 16, intro.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> has nearly the same signification as the word last
noticed, and is frequently used along with it, to define
the other member of the comparison. <i>As</i> far <i>as</i> I can understand,
<i>so</i> far I approve. <i>As</i> he directed, <i>so</i> I obeyed.
It very often occurs as a secondary adjective; as, "In pious
and benevolent offices <i>so</i> simple, <i>so</i> minute, <i>so</i> steady, <i>so</i>
habitual, that they will carry," etc. "He pursued a course
<i>so</i> unvarying."&mdash;<i>Channing.</i></p>

<p>These words are the most important of any small ones in
our vocabulary, because (<i>for this cause</i>, be this the cause,
this is the cause) they are the most frequently used; and
yet there are no words <i>so</i> little understood, or <i>so</i> much
abused by grammarians, <i>as</i> these are.</p>

<p>We have barely time to notice the remaining parts of
speech. "Conjunctions" are defined to be a "part of speech
void of signification, but so formed as to help signification,
by making two or more significant sentences to be one significant
sentence." Mr. Harris gives about forty "species."
Murray admits of only the <i>dis</i>-junctive and copulative, and
reduces the whole list of words to twenty-four. But what
is meant by a <i>dis</i>-junctive <i>con</i>-junctive word, is left for you
to determine. It must be in keeping with <i>in</i>definite <i>defining</i>
articles, and <i>post</i>-positive <i>pre</i>-positions. He says, "it joins
words, but disjoins the
sense."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
And what is a <i>word</i> with out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<i>sense</i>," pray tell us? If "words are the signs of ideas,"
how, in the name of reason, can you give the sign and separate
the sense? You can as well separate the shadow from
the substance, or a quality from matter.</p>

<p>We have already noticed Rule 18, which teaches the use
of conjunctions. Under that rule, you may examine these examples.
"As it <i>was</i> in the beginning, <i>is</i> now, <i>and</i> ever <i>shall
be</i>."&mdash;<i>Common Prayer.</i> "What I <i>do</i>, <i>have done,</i> or <i>may</i> hereafter
<i>do</i>, <i>has been</i>, and <i>will</i> always <i>be</i> matter of inclination,
the gratifying of which <i>pays</i> itself: and I <i>have</i> no more merit
in employing my time and money in the way I <i>am known</i>
to do, than another has in other occupations."&mdash;<i>Howard.</i></p>

<p>The following examples must suffice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If.</span> This word is derived from the saxon <i>gifan</i>, and was
formerly written <i>giff</i>, <i>gyff</i>, <i>gif</i>, <i>geve</i>, <i>give</i>, <i>yiff</i>, <i>yef</i>, <i>yeve</i>. It
signifies <i>give</i>, <i>grant</i>, <i>allow</i>, <i>suppose</i>, <i>admit</i>, and is always a
verb in the imperative mood, having the following sentence
or idea for its object. "<i>If</i> a pound of sugar cost ten cents,
what will ten pounds cost?" <i>Give</i>, grant, allow, suppose,
(the fact,) <i>one pound cost</i>, etc. In this case the supposition
which stands as a predicate&mdash;<i>one pound of sugar cost ten
cents</i>, is the object of <i>if</i>&mdash;the thing to be allowed, supposed,
or granted, and from which the conclusion as to the cost of
<i>ten</i> pounds is to be drawn.</p>

<p>"He will assist us if he has the means." Allow, admit,
(the fact,) he has the means, he will assist us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But.</span> This word has two opposite significations. It is
derived from two different radicals. <i>But</i>, from the saxon
<i>be</i> and <i>utan</i>, <i>out</i>, means <i>be out</i>, <i>leave out</i>, <i>save</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>omit</i>, as,
"all <i>but</i> one are here." <i>Leave out</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>one</i>, all are here.</p>

<p><i>But</i> is also derived from <i>botan</i>, which signifies <i>to add</i>,
<i>superadd</i>, <i>join</i> or <i>unite</i>; as, in the old form of a deed, "it
is <i>butted</i> and bounded as follows." Two animals <i>butt</i> their
heads together. The <i>butt</i> of a log is that end which was
<i>joined</i> to the stump. A <i>butt</i>, <i>butment</i> or <i>a-butment</i> is the
joined end, where there is a connexion with something else.

spelled <i>botan</i>, <i>boote</i>, <i>bote</i>, <i>bot</i>, <i>butte</i>, <i>bute</i>, <i>but</i>. It is still

<p><i>Let</i> presents the same construction in form and meaning
as <i>but</i>, for it is derived from two radicals of opposite significations.
It means sometimes to <i>permit</i> or <i>allow</i>; as, <i>let</i>
me go; <i>let</i> me have it; and to <i>hinder</i> or <i>prevent</i>; as, "I
proposed to come unto you, <i>but</i> (add this fact) I was <i>let</i>
hitherto."&mdash;<i>Rom. 1: 13.</i> "He who now <i>letteth</i>, will <i>let</i>
until he be taken out of the way."&mdash;<i>2 Thess. 2: 7.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> is a past participle signifying <i>added</i>, <i>one-ed</i>, <i>joined</i>.
It was formerly placed after the words; as, "James, John,
David, <i>and</i>, (<i>united to-</i>gether<i>-ed</i>,) go to school." We now
place it <i>before</i> the last word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tho</span>, <i>altho</i>, <i>yet</i>. "Tho (<i>admit</i>, <i>allow</i>, <i>the fact</i>) he slay
me, yet (<i>get</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>know</i>, <i>the fact</i>) I will trust in him." <i>Yes</i>
is from the same word as <i>yet</i>. It means <i>get</i> or <i>have</i> my
consent to the question asked. <i>Nay</i> is the opposite of <i>yes</i>,
<i>ne</i>-aye, nay, no. The <i>ayes</i> and <i>noes</i> were called for.</p>

<p>I can pursue this matter no farther. The limits assigned
me have been overrun already. What light may have been
afforded you in relation to these words, will enable you to
discover that they have <i>meaning</i> which must be learned before
they can be explained correctly; that done, all difficulty
is removed.</p>

<p>Interjections deserve no attention. They form no part
of language, but may be used by beasts and birds as well
as by men. They are indistinct utterances of emotions,
which come not within the range of human speech.</p>

Gall, Spurzheim, and Combe, have reflected a light upon the
science of the mind, which cannot fail of beneficial results. Tho
the doctrines of phrenology, as now taught, may prove false&mdash;which
is quite doubtful&mdash;or receive extensive modifications, yet the consequences
to the philosophy of the mind will be vastly useful. The
very terms employed to express the faculties and affections of the
mind, are so definite and clear, that phrenology will long deserve
peculiar regard, if for no other reason than for the introduction of a
vocabulary, from which may be selected words for the communication
of ideas upon intellectual subjects.</p></div>

Metaphysics originally signified the science of the causes and
principles of all things. Afterwards it was confined to the philosophy
of the mind. In our times it has obtained still another meaning.
Metaphysicians became so abstruse, bewildered, and lost, that
nobody could understand them; and hence, <i>metaphysical</i> is now
applied to whatever is abstruse, doubtful, and unintelligible. If a
speaker is not understood, it is because he is too metaphysical.
"How did you like the sermon, yesterday?" "Tolerably well; but
he was too metaphysical for common hearers." They could not understand
him.</p></div>

In this respect, many foreign languages possess a great advantage
over ours. They can augment or diminish the same word to
increase or lessen the meaning. For instance; in the Spanish, we
can say <i>Hombre</i>, a man; <i>Hombron</i>, a <i>large</i> man; <i>Hombrecito</i>, a
<i>young</i> man, or youth; <i>Hombrecillo</i>, a <i>miserable little</i> man; <i>Pagaro</i>,
a bird; <i>Pagarito</i>, a <i>pretty little</i> bird; <i>Perro</i>, a dog; <i>Perrillo</i>,
an <i>ugly little</i> dog; <i>Perrazo</i>, a <i>large</i> dog.</p>

<p>The Indian languages admit of diminutives in a similar way. In
the Delaware dialect, they are formed by the suffix <i>tit</i>, in the class
of animate nouns; but by <i>es</i>, to the inanimate; as, <i>Senno</i>, a man;
<i>Sennotit</i>, a <i>little</i> man; <i>Wikwam</i>, a house; <i>Wikwames</i>, a <i>small</i>
house.&mdash;<i>Enc. Amer. Art. Indian Languages, vol. 6, p. 586.</i></p></div>

more probable from the fact, that a tax is laid, by the Ottoman
Porte, on all olive trees planted since Palestine passed into the possession
of the Turks, and that several trees standing in Gethsemane
do not pay such tribute, while all others do.</p></div>

We do not assent to the notions of ancient philosophers and
poets, who believed the doctrine that the world is animated by a
soul, like the human body, which is the spirit of Deity himself; but
that by the operation of wise and perfect laws, he exerts a supervision
in the creation and preservation of all things animate and inanimate.

The Jews long preserved this name in Samaritan letters to
keep it from being known to strangers. The modern Jews affirm
that by this mysterious name, engraven on his rod, Moses performed
the wonders recorded of him; that Jesus stole the name
from the temple and put it into his thigh between the flesh and
skin, and by its power accomplished the miracles attributed to him.
They think if they could pronounce the word correctly, the very
heavens and earth would tremble, and angels be filled with terror.</p></div>

Plutarch says, "This title is not only <i>proper</i> but <i>peculiar to
God</i>, because <span class="smcap">He</span> alone is <i>being</i>; for mortals have no participation
of <i>true being</i>, because that which <i>begins</i> and <i>ends</i>, and is constantly
<i>changing</i>, is never <i>one</i> nor the <i>same</i>, nor in the same state. The
deity on whose temple this word was inscribed was called <span class="smcap">Apollo</span>,
Apollon, from <i>a</i> negative and <i>pollus</i>, <i>many</i>, because God is <span class="smcap">one</span>,
his nature simple, and <i>uncompounded</i>."&mdash;<i>Vide, Clark's Com.</i></p></div>

The same fact may be observed in other languages, for all people
form language alike, in a way to correspond with their ideas.

Mr. Murray says, "These compounds," <i>have</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>may</i>,
<i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, <i>had</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, and <i>should</i>, which he uses as
auxiliaries to <i>help</i> conjugate <i>other</i> verbs, "are, however, to be considered
as <i>different forms</i> of the <i>same</i> verb." I should like to know,
if these words have any thing to do with the <i>principal</i> verbs; if they
only alter the <i>form</i> of the verb which follows them. I <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>,
<i>must</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, or <i>do love</i>. Are these only different forms of
<i>love</i>? or rather, are they not distinct, important, and original verbs,
pure and perfect <i>in</i> and <i>of</i> themselves? Ask for their etymons and
meaning, and then decide.</p></div>

Dr. Edwards observes, in a communication to the Connecticut
Society of Arts and Sciences, from personal knowledge, that "the
Mohegans (Indians) have <i>no adjectives</i> in all their language. Altho
it may at first seem not only singular and curious, but impossible,
that a language should exist without adjectives, yet it is an
indubitable fact." But it is proved that in later times the Indians
employ adjectives, derived from nouns or verbs, as well as other
nations. Altho many of their dialects are copious and harmonious,
yet they suffered no inconvenience from a want of contracted words
and phrases. They added the ideas of definition and description to
the things themselves, and expressed them in the <i>same</i> word, in a
modified form.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org
